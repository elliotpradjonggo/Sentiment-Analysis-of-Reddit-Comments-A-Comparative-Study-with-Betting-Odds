Half an hour in, Lampard gave Tariq Lamptey his Chelsea debut and took the experienced player Emerson off. Lamptey bossed it and helped lead the comeback. Tammy Abraham, Fikyao Tomori, Mason Mount, Reece James, Callum Hudson-Odoi all played in that match. Now Chukwuemeka can't make the match day squad, Lewis Hall played a meaningless friendly against Monaco U21s today. \n\n6 consecutive defeats. 2 goals scored. Those who \"deserve to play\" are failing while those who have to \"earn their spot\" are being neglected for literally zero reason other than trying to save face. Lampard had a prime opportunity to at least galvanize the fan base with what made his first tenure so fun and he's botched it so spectacularly and fielded a team made up of majority players who have been searching for the exit door the minute the last game is over. \n\nHe can draw a line with Joao Felix but Sterling, Kovacic can still roam around the pitch not giving any effort or fucking up for the 100th time in 10 minutes and he sees nothing wrong with that. Play the washed up corpse of Cesar Azpilicueta but not Chalobah. \n\nNone of this makes sense. It's all infuriating. This summer is so, so important like you wouldn't believe."

Chelsea were absolutely there for a battering; 5 or 6 goals would\u2019ve helped put the misery of the past few weeks behind.\n\nLosing a clean sheet didn\u2019t help either.\n\nNow we can only wait for City to somehow drop points.\n\nI really wish Gabriel recovers before the weekend.\n\nAnd i really want Saka to be rested for a game; but again i don\u2019t expect that to happen this weekend given the stature of the game.\n\nAlso, i knew a Chelsea were having bad season but in the first half they struggled to string 4 passes together coherently.

Need Saka to get back to his usual standard on Sunday. I thought Jorginho was quality and Xhaka had a couple good moments.\n\nZinny needs to be benched. He\u2019s been beaten/ turned the ball over far too many times lately. KT needs a run out. \n\nChelsea players need to refund their fans. That was a spineless performance.
