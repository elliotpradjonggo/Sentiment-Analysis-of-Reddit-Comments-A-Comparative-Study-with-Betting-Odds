2022-11-06 08:55:54,William Saliba, what a player,-1,1
"2022-11-06 09:00:06,""Neither Jesus nor Auba on the scoresheet, but holy fuck they are miles apart in terms of contribution. Jesus’ hold up play is insane for his size, his dribbling and passing creates a lot of chances, and he constantly harries opposing defenders making sure they can’t dally on the ball. I don’t know where he left his shooting boots, but he’s doing everything else fantastically so he’s still such an asset on the pitch."",-1,1"
2022-11-06 09:06:54,Silva is literally single-handedly holding this Chelsea back line (maybe squad) together. Literally reminds me of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man train scene,-1,1

2022-11-06 08:58:23,City dodged a whole ass missile with Cucurella,-1,1
2022-11-06 08:59:15,How does Jesus manage to put an 8/10 game without scoring every week... Partey was immense... Saliba Rolls Royce as usual... Ode should have scored but decent game... Martinelli put a good shift,-1,1

"2022-11-06 09:00:49,""We beat Liverpool, Tottenham, and now Chelsea at the Bridge.. this is our best start EVER, and yet I don't think we're genuine contenders because of Man City aka Kang. I will say tho, this must've been cathartic for Arsenal fans watching Saliba just snuff every Chelsea attack like he's prime John Terry."",-1,1"
2022-11-06 08:55:27,Potter playing Chelsea like an English Stoke.,-1,1
"2022-11-06 08:59:14,""The way Sterling is being used is so tragic. Whenever he gets the ball there is nobody to pass to, he is close to the touchline and is deep in his own half. He’s basically being asked to be Hazard lmao, progress the ball from the deep and score a goal or create a chance from nothing and carry the attack"",-1,1"
2022-11-06 08:57:10,Auba really said it's not personal Arsenal just to ghost out during the entire match lmao,-1,1
"2022-11-06 08:58:05,""Watching Auba suck ass today was a treat. The bigger shock for me today was watching Sterling being so ineffective and useless. How can you make a strike force of Sterling, Pulisic, Auba, Havertz, and Mount as ineffectual as they were today was hilarious. Ben White and Jesus were my MOTM. Jesus deserves a hat-trick at least for the work he does for the team."",-1,1"
2022-11-06 08:59:08,Bro partey and saliba are really performing like some of the best midfielder/defender in the pl right now,-1,1

"2022-11-06 09:11:52,""It’s so funny how people think that Gabriel Jesus headed chance is a sitter. The ball was, albeit inches, too far in front of him."",-1,1"
"2022-11-06 11:32:54,""Chelsea has been a wing-back-focused team since Lampard came in. The second James and Chilwell get injured, our season is over. Story of every season."",-1,1"
2022-11-06 09:03:40,I still think Tuchel's sacking was the most reactionary course of action possible for Chelsea,-1,0
2022-11-06 08:56:45,This Saliba guy could be an all-timer for Arsenal. He’s one of the best young defenders I’ve seen.,-1,1
"2022-11-06 09:22:12,""For Chelsea, T Silva was very good, especially for a 38-year-old! Azpilicueta did well to keep Martinelli quiet for most of the game, but Arsenal's all-around performance and desire are what they had over Chelsea. Surprisingly very little attacking for Chelsea."",-1,1"

"2022-11-06 09:00:50,""Cucurella holding onto that Arsenal player for the goal was pretty funny. Looked like a toddler who is too shy to talk to the relatives."",-1,1"
"2022-11-06 09:20:57,""Thiago Silva best Chelsea player by far. Don’t even know who would be second in this game. Probably Azpi or Chalobah."",-1,1"

"2022-11-06 09:08:01,""Every Gooner would agree with me in that, Top 4 is still our Target, whatever happens after happens, but Top 4 is a must. Won't be getting carried away yet, we've been incredible, but alas, top 4 please."",-1,1"

2022-11-06 08:58:27,2.38 xG vs 0.24. utterly dominated,-1,1
"2022-11-06 15:58:33,""Arsenal looked great tbh. Especially some of that link-up play in and around the midfield. As for us too many things. We've got James, Chilwell, Kanté, Fofana out. Our system is such that depends heavily on wing backs to create. And losing both is tragic. Kova and Koulibaly aren't fit. That's like half the team there. Potter is still new and obviously it will take him time. For example, we played a back 4 today, and we played a back 4 last game, 3atb before that. We're still finding our feet. Lots of work needs to be done. The World Cup break can't come soon enough."",-1,1"
"2022-11-06 09:02:01,""Does anyone have a video of the one-touch buildup arsenal did from the back? Shit was insane"",-1,1"
2022-11-06 08:55:44,Nothing personal Aubameyang ??,-1,0
"2022-11-06 08:57:39,""Its quite interesting watching Chelsea at the moment compared to a lot of teams in and around them. You have to ask what is the actual identity of this team. You look at Arsenal and you can see who is a true and true Arsenal player. The cliche of club DNA ETC…Chelsea seem lost in a void especially now James and Chilwell are injured. They lack all sorts of personality and drive. You then have players like. Silva and Azpilicueta seem to be the only ones who care about the shirt but they are in the twilight of their careers. Mount seems constantly lost. Sterling is a complete waste. Loftus Cheek looks paces behind everyone else. The whole team just seems fucking lost and Chelsea itself seems completely void of any identity and personality. Potter is new to his job but this is going to take such an overhaul. What does it mean to be a Chelsea player. What is the club truly about. Chelsea seems to go through this every few years but this seems to be more troubling that usual.Its going to be a very long long long season for them at this rate."",-1,1"
"2022-11-06 08:58:53,""Chelsea look so disjointed. They probably will be looking for a complete overhaul of their attack come for the next 2 transfer windows. We hardly got out of 3rd gear and yet were much better. Ben White was immense."",-1,1"

2022-11-06 09:09:05,Gabriel was top quality today. Has been making a few errors recently, but hardly put a foot wrong here,-1,1
"2022-11-06 10:24:38,""Chelsea have next to none physicality in midfield. No pressing, almost always lose 50-50 balls, can't hold the ball, can't dribble past defending player 1v1. Hope it will change when all the DF players back to health, although the hole in midfield still has no answer."",-1,1"

2022-11-06 09:06:02,Chelsea need a reset. They have no attacking identity, and haven’t had one for years. Tuchel steadied the backline but after losing Rudiger and Christensen, and recurring injuries to Chilwell and Reece James that foundation is gone.,-1,1

2022-11-06 09:46:29,Don't get what the big controversy is, Arsenal were the much better team. the way they defended shows you that it's not just that Chelsea were bad, it's that Arsenal are playing with confidence.,-1,1

2022-11-06 09:55:26,A typical 1-0 dominant game. Jesus needs to find his shooting boots, but apart from that, he is perfect. What was the last time Arsenal beat Liverpool, Hotspurs, and Chelsea in the first leg of the season?,-1,1
2022-11-06 09:01:04,Great win, dominated the game, it felt like we won most of the aerial duels as well. The only bad thing is we could've been 2 or 3 goals up. Jesus should've scored, but he's bringing so much with his passes, hold up play, and dribbling. He'll score sooner or later,-1,1

2022-11-06 08:59:02,I know they're missing a few players but what a perplexing performance from Chelsea. Leeds, Southampton, Fulham, etc. all gave us far more to worry about. Lord knows what happened to Kai Havertz - I thought they'd made an incredible signing with him.,-1,1

2022-11-06 09:04:47,Arsenal have beaten Chelsea / Liverpool / Tottenham and earn full points in front of them, and some people doubt the ability of this team to compete for the title, a team with a clear and aggressive technical identity, in the three stages of playing the team is distinguished, the team system is coherent in front of technically stable teams more than them, Arteta offers Unique football. Goodluck.,-1,1

2022-11-06 08:55:25,What a shithouse game crowned by shithouse goal. But my lord were Chelsea terrible in attack. Was it 2 shots and only 1 of those on target?,-1,0
2022-11-06 08:55:31,Xhaka hitting Jorginho with the classic “scoreboard” at the end there. Nothing you can say against that,0,1

2022-11-06 09:14:18,Great game guys, saliba and GJ were beasts. GJ could’ve buried that header, but fuck me man. That guy runs 90 minutes at a chaotic rate. Saliba is so fucking good man. Guy is on his way to be world class. Happy to see Zinny get back in the game. Martinelli was a bit wank, but he’s young and Azpi was good today. Great team win, team looks bought in on Arteta. Hopefully our World Cup players stay healthy,0,1
2022-11-06 09:18:49,Xhaka was sublime again, he did everything perfectly. What a fucking player!!,0,1

2022-11-06 09:34:12,I'm so proud of this team man, what a performance, complete domination from minute 1, this team will win the league in the next 2-3 years I'm sure of it.,-1,1
2022-11-06 09:04:45,1-0 but Arsenal showed levels today, the Bridge belongs to the Arse now ?????,-1,1

2022-11-06 08:59:58,Potterball is fucking massive. Tuchel was holding these players back,-1,0
2022-11-06 09:00:43,Look ill be honest I expected chelsea to lose this with the amount of injuries but man the way we conceded, the way we can't fucking play out of the back. Why does Aubameyang start every game, he gives nothing off the ball, i thought Potter picked on form and not big names. Why not play 3 midfielders when it was obvious that was needed, complete disconnect between attack and defense. At what point does one give up on RLC, man has the skill but is hiding every game, never a risky pass or shot. Another jorginho? Pointless. Only kovacic looks good enough for chelsea at the moment. Real questions for potter now all that talk of dynamism but we get sitting back against arsenal at home and losing.,-1,0
2022-11-06 09:02:28,I need someone who knows ball better than me to explain how starting a midfield 3 with Zakaria in would've been worse than whatever we tried today\n\nAbsolutely shambolic performance all around, this team has no desire to step up to the plate,-1,0
2022-11-06 08:57:42,Lmao Xhaka just dropped an f-bomb live,0,0
2022-11-06 09:01:00,We played that game like it was at the Emirates and I love that man. This team is mentally so strong and composed. \n\nI almost cannot believe how talented this backline is...Thomas and Granit...Absolutely colossal. Pure dominance.,-1,1
2022-11-06 09:02:08,People won’t want to hear this but Pulisic has been better than Mount, Sterling, and Auba with drastically less minutes. He at the very least plays like he gives a fuck. Mount is a shell of his former self. Sterling is useless and Auba is beyond isolated.,-1,0

2022-11-06 09:09:53,You just knew Auba was going to have a stinker. Absolutely woeful performance from him again.,-1,1
2022-11-06 09:56:40,So sad to watch. Our descent into a mid table side has started.,-1,0
2022-11-06 09:00:16,Man what the fuck is Saliba all about? Some of the balls he casually picks up are often unbreakable opportunities elsewhere, he's delicious on the ball too. Boy made Potter's Chelsea his bitch. What an absolute beast!,1,-1
2022-11-06 09:01:55,Arsenal being the best team in the country is a world I'm happy to live in, long may it continue.,1,0
2022-11-06 10:35:47,I don’t think Chelsea are in poor form, I think they aren’t good and Kante covered over their form. Kante is so damn good he makes any team with half decent talent a top 4 team. Makes every team exponentially better.,-1,0


2022-11-06 08:56:30,For all the hype of Aubameyang playing against Arsenal, you have to appreciate Potter’s gall to not play him at all.,0,-1

2022-11-06 08:58:17,It’s been said before but it’s so so nice to gain confidence and not lose steam when we’re playing good. Saliba was fantastic as always. Got a bit scrappier than it needed to be tho.,-1,1

2022-11-06 09:03:39,I know it's desperation, but subbing Aubameyang for Broja and then starting hitting long balls past our defenders is a questionable strategy.,-1,0
2022-11-06 09:04:11,Midfield did absolutely nothing, completely shut down by Arsenal's press. Lucky it wasn't more than 1-0. Frustrating game,-1,1

2022-11-06 08:58:25,Have Chelsea resorted to fucking up the pitch like atletico does for tough games? Or is the standard of that pitch just this?,-1,0


2022-11-06 09:02:06,I believe the change in Arsenal is attributed to the fact that bad actors in the club have gone. And I mean Aubameyang and Lacazette. Body language totally different with the same players. The team is rallying behind Xhaka and Arteta now.,1,-1

2022-11-06 09:03:11,Are Chelsea totally toothless? This felt like one of the best defensive performances I can remember from Arsenal.  That back line is absolute class.,-1,1


"2022-11-06 08:57:31,""Fucking unbelievable, Jeff."",0,0"
2022-11-06 08:58:05,Arsenal’s press just didn’t let Chelsea get comfortable and they managed to keep it up for most of the game.  Just feels like when Arsenal come out of the back they know where each other  are whereas Chelsea looked a bit more like they were still in preseason. To be fair to Potter he hasn’t really had that much time to work with the squad so can’t really write him off yet.  Will be interesting to see how they go post-World Cup although I don’t really know how many players in their squad won’t be going.,-1,1


2022-11-06 09:15:35,Auba getting hooked for ... *reads hand* Armando Broja … If that isn't writing on the wall, I don't know what is,-1,0

2022-11-06 09:02:02,'Arsenal masterclass and Graham Potter nuclear disasterclass' is how I would term this match. Tuchel's influence might've been waning, but even in that game against Spurs, it was very clear that he was really good in the big games.,-1,1


2022-11-06 09:04:53,Fuck me what a dreadful display. Totally toothless. Why Havertz continues to start is beyond me.,-1,0

2022-11-06 09:05:59,As someone whose team it took 18 years to win the league again, I really hope Arsenal can keep it up until the end of the season and that it won't be like the 2014 Liverpool becoming 2nd season.,0,0
2022-11-06 09:13:27,I think Arsenal is going to fight the title down to the end. They show a ton of steel and have knocked off a lot of the top clubs so far. I think they may find a way to pip City to the title.,0,1
