2022-10-01 09:32:03,"You got to give Arteta credit for improving Xhaka and playing him in the right position, Xhaka has been solid this season. Right now Saliba is one of the best defenders in the Premier League and he's  so comfortable with playing out in the back which means Saliba is pretty much press resistant\n\nJesus work rate was incredible in the match and the Spurs defence couldn't deal with him. You could tell that he's happy to be the main man.",1,-1
2022-10-01 09:28:38,"Spurs fans have to be concerned that their side cant keep the ball at all in these big games. At Chelsea Conte had Fabregas and Kante and at times Hazard to really keep possession. \n\nTheir transitions are dangerous but they can not keep the ball at important moments,-1,0

2022-10-01 09:25:38,"That was enjoyable for obvious reasons but chiefly because after conceding in the first half we pulled it together to come back in the second and show them what quality we can have.

Last year the wouldve panic their way out of the game after the Penalty goal from Kane and the pressure from Son.\n \nBut they held their composure way better when shit wasnt going their way.
