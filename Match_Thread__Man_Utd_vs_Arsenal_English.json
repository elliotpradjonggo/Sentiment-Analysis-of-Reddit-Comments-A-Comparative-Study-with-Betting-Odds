Tough game to lose from an Arsenal perspective given there was periods of really good play, which just lacked decision making in the box. Arsenal really missing Partey and Elneny. Sambi had some good touches but he drifts to forward for the position and role he was needed in for today which left our back line exposed. Mistakes from the back line where punished. Hoping for a bounce back from Arsenal. Our overall quality is drastically improved but if we don\u2019t finish off chances there will be more games like this.\n\nThough United\u2019s goals where from counters, that first 10 minutes of pressing looked good. If Casemeiro gets going they look strong. However I personally can\u2019t stand Bruno Fernandez."
