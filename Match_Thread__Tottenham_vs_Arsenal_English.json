Lloris was a great keeper one of the best in the league at his best, but he\u2019s stuck around for a few more years than he should have. Ramsdale was mocked (I thought it was bad too) but Arteta knew we needed a modern keeper. Leno a great shot stopper but he\u2019s so poor at dealing with crosses and wasn\u2019t as comfortable on the ball. Today it showed arsenal were able to dominate the ball first half and play out from the back effectively also making a great save that probably saved the momentum, Lloris howler that gave us the momentum and spurs couldn\u2019t play out first half at all. \n\nAlso Harry Kane in north London derbies without pens is basically Chris wood, son was anonymous like he has been all this season, Kulu was their brightest player for sure the only real stand out. Happy we kept our cool in this heated game and finally won away."
