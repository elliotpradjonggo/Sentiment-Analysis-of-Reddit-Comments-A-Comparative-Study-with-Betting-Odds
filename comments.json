There's numerous instances where players should've but didn't get booked. No foul accumulation either.\n\n* Romero making it his mission to try to injure Havertz.\n\n* Cucurella being pulled down by the hair and VAR doesn't deem that as dangerous play.\n\n* James taking out Son in the first half but also body checking Kane in a reasonably dangerous area.\n\nThe only element that he appeared to do okay on was the bench antics - both Tuchel and Conte receiving red cards appears more than fair as it takes two to tango and both were evidently heated up by the game.\n\nIf he's not demoted to a Championship game or has to take a week or two out then that all but proves that the referees are seen to be invincible. That have to take responsibility for their actions (or in this case, inactions) and have to better themselves. If nothing is done then, to me, that means they can continue in that kind of form week in, week out."

They were punished for a few mistakes but they look dangerous, especially when their forwards had some space. The ball movement is fantastic and Jesus looks more dangerous than almost anyone else in the league right now. \n\nJust a really fun Sunday afternoon game."

This is clearly not the same United team that Brentford tore apart weeks ago and while we really would have liked something here a loss isn't devastating to our top four hopes.\n\nMidweek fixture against Zurich will add fatigue complications but also provides a good opportunity to shake this off quickly instead of dwelling on it for another few days. Then two very winnable PL games in Everton and Brentford to allow us to get our momentum going again before the North London Derby.\n\nClearly have some big problems with our transition defense that will need to be sorted, but Arteta has given us no reason to think he won't be able to come up with something. His subs today were a little suspect but his long-term tactics have been working very well, hopefully that continues.\n\nVieira certainly had an interesting debut but I loved the clear determination and desire he showed every time he was near the ball. Excited to see more of him.\n\nHats off to United. Masterful game from Eriksen and United's finishing was superb. Just like our situation last year, they have done so well to shake off those disastrous first fixtures and get their football right. That's not easy to do but they have done it and then some.\n\nFinally, after all this shit refs have gotten this weekend, I want to give a shoutout to Tierney. Yeah, there were a couple missed calls here and there but overall he and his crew had a very good game, and that deserves to be recognized."

Eriksen must be loving life. \n\nMartinez and Varane were great once again. Absolutely loving this new look United side. United is having a laugh looking at the bench and being able to throw on players like Ronaldo and Casemiro. \n\nCredit to Arsenal. There were pockets of the game where they made things difficult. I remember 15\u2019-35\u2019 was tough, then they conceded and they felt the pain of being in Old Trafford again.  Anyway, they are a quality side but Untied was too aggressive, too good today.

Eriksen still has it, man was fantastic!\n\nThat said, we were very good today as well, just a little naive in chasing the game. Once Rashford\u2019s goal went in against the run of play there were too many changes and we lost our shape. Jesus was incredible, smoked Varane and Martinez alike so many times and was always lively. Saka broke his duck finally and he did well, but not quite up to his level last season. Saliba looked a bit out of sorts today but he still did well.\n\nAll in all the score line flatters United a bit but it also shows how efficient they can be. This was a close game, and we need to learn to be more composed. Top 4 is going to be a very interesting battle."

Regarding Arsenal, they should end up on in the CL positions but that defensive area needs to be shored up. I suspect they could get badly punished by City and Liverpool on a good day."

At times arsenals attacking was really fluid and captivating, just missing that clinical last pass or lucky bounce. \n\nI prefer the way they play football to Man U, I have a bias against counter attacking reliant teams cause it gets kind of boring fast. With that said Ten Hag has done a great job, this defense looks really fkn good and the counter attacking is effective. Man U are one of those teams where if the game is even they will eventually find a goal and beat you.\n\nArsenal fans should be proud of the team still, they try to play really nice football, and there is a reason why teams generally don\u2019t win their first 6 games\u2026. It\u2019s hard. Also United are not a bad team anymore, they are powerful counter attack merchants"

Fans can make excuses but at the end of the day the score is 3-1 and we lost. The same Arsenal team I would gladly tell you is our most impressive side in the last decade went to Old Trafford and lost... a loss that should be absolutely soul crushing but it's hard to remain upset for very long. Ultimately I'm just excited to see them play their next game. Say what you like but if you think this is Arsenal *humbled* or *exposed* you're in for a rude awakening because they have come a long way since having a back line of Kolasinac, Sokratis, Mustafi and Bellerin."

Think united were fine - and took their chances, but we really gave that away (by not creating enough out of our dominance, and a sloppy high line).\n\n\nBut honestly we aren't a title contending team and if you ignore reddit fans creating strawmans, and the media, most arsenal fans are well aware we are short.\n\n\nThink it was still overall a decent performance at times, but we really are still that 10% off in either box. Top 4 would be a great season imo, and I expect it to be 5 teams fighting for it. Won't be easy. \n\nGoing to have to ignore the reddit 'banter' about us now losing, much the same way I ignored people pretending we were suddenly amazing. We were never going to win the league, and equally, despite this defeat, we played well and are still top of the league. As always, reality is in the middle of the two extremes\n\nArteta's system looks good, we have a young talented side and I love watching our style of play. Hopefully we push on from here, but we do need to start learning to be a bit more clinical. Guess good job from united to be ruthless against us."

Tough game to lose from an Arsenal perspective given there was periods of really good play, which just lacked decision making in the box. Arsenal really missing Partey and Elneny. Sambi had some good touches but he drifts to forward for the position and role he was needed in for today which left our back line exposed. Mistakes from the back line where punished. Hoping for a bounce back from Arsenal. Our overall quality is drastically improved but if we don\u2019t finish off chances there will be more games like this.\n\nThough United\u2019s goals where from counters, that first 10 minutes of pressing looked good. If Casemeiro gets going they look strong. However I personally can\u2019t stand Bruno Fernandez."

Thought we were really good today, Partey is just so damn composed and smooth. Saka wasn\u2019t super impactful, but as soon as he wasn\u2019t double marked, the second goal happened. Need Martinelli to be more lethal in his finishing, he could\u2019ve had 2 today. Saliba was class. I was interested to see how he matched up against Kane/son."

Arsenal are one of the best teams in the league right now and we're at the Emirates so I never expected a win and hoped for a draw at best. Came down to a controversial penalty winner in the end but I think it's probably a fair result given how well they played in the second half and ET of the first half. Well done to both teams.\n\nAnd well done to Nunez in particular for actually getting a goal btw. That was probably the most surprising moment of the whole game for me.

There\u2019s a few of those we need to finish off cause an in form Liverpool won\u2019t be this wasteful on the ball. Martinelli is just balling off the charts. Back line had a couple shaky moments, but saliba is that guy right now. Absolute baller. Wish we would\u2019ve seen eddie come on for Jesus. I thought he was knocked out cold. Does anyone know what happened when Oliver spoke to the managers? I thought he was gonna  them to chill their players out. Of course the rumor mill on Twitter was running about stuff.

I doubt we are going to push city realistically, but just seeing this type of progress in terms of technique, tactics and hopefully, mentality, is testament to the work Arteta and co. have done the last few years.\n\n\nRegardless of where we end up finishing this season...

Saliba as usual, such a calm influence. Ben White was fantastic too. \n\nOdegaard stepped up today, great pass for that first goal. He led the press as usual very well. Xhaka & Partey much better 2nd half too. \n\nGabriel Jesus has given his life since he signed for us. Top performance, even though Liverpool were relentless in their pressing on him when he tried to drop deep. \n\nSaka, big boy penalty. So much pressure, cooly taken. Arteta we\u2019ve had our problems but you got it spot on as most of this season, the subs could\u2019ve been a bit earlier but I\u2019m only nitpicking. \n\nWatch out for Fabio Vieira btw, that boy is special too. Reminds me of Martinelli- totally different player, but his talent is spellbinding. \n\nI can\u2019t even think about the Title as I don\u2019t see it as a possibility given the machine Manchester City are.

Liverpool played in an unusual formation throughout, and seemed to shift around radically. Gomez, Salah and Milner were exceptional. Thiago was great, though lucky not to see a red card from his slip. More worries about injuries, Jota didn't look happy at the end, and Darwin was... present, I guess. We could have dropped points at the end mostly through Darwin not picking the right pass. A very solid and tenacious display across the team, and we simply deserved this result. City didn't play badly in most of the game, but a few small mistakes made the difference.\n\nVery pleased, and let's hope we can keep this kind of effort up."

Two or three times they just put the ball into where Haaland was, despite him having multiple defenders around him. \n\nOne of the benefits of having a striker like Haaland is the fact he's able to create space for others by having multiple defenders on him, but there were points where City just seemed to forget that other players would be in space; I counted two or three times where there was a huge gap between Haaland on the six-yard line and players in space on the edge of the box. No City player went to fill that space, and the ball just kept going towards Haaland."

Utd were superb and constantly left spurs players in their wake, but won't have an easier day in terms of build up and the first phase, they maintained attacks well especially in the 2nd half."

Terrible all over the pitch, but especially in defence and midfield, they couldn\u2019t get the ball out, suppose credit is due to United because they were all over them pressing. \n\nUnited dicked them for 90 minutes basically, Ronaldo still tried to make it about himself by leaving early as well \ud83e\udd23"

We weren't always getting it all our way but the players stuck to it and didn't shy away from hard work as they have done so much over the last few years and they didn't collapse after conceding a stupid penalty.\n\nOn the other hand, we really have to use the ball better, especially in the final third. Sancho looks a shadow of the player he was at Dortmund, hopefully ten Hag can coax something our of him over the winter because I doubt he's going g to the world cup.\n\nRashford is doing a decent job, but he really isn't a centre forward. You can see from his movement he doesn't have that killer instinct or ability to get himself into good goalscoring positions. With Martial constantly injured and Ronaldo hopefully dumped we really need to reinforce this position in January."

That gave Chelsea a lot more stability in the midfield and they started to dominate the possession of the ball as well. However, Chelsea didn't deserve a 1-0 win at all, they weren't good enough even with possession of the ball. \n\n\nI did notice our players were either tired or just not into the game in the second half, good call on Ten Haag to take off Sancho. Sancho was useless. Fred brought some much needed energy to the midfield even if his touch is lacking as usual.\n\n\nMctominay should go get his head checked. Aggression is good but you need to know when to have a cool head.\n\n\nWe need a striker in January. If cr7 is to leave, we definitely need to buy one at least. Martial cannot be relied upon due to his injury record and it's clear to everyone to Rashford operates best on the wings and not centrally. I hope Ten Haag is communicating this to the board and directors. We shouldn't expect top 4 without a striker, we don't have false 9 Messi nor is our attacking style similar to Pep and his attacking mids."

Also sums up Chelsea\u2019s season really. Especially that fourth goal. \n\nThey have been off their paces for quite some time now. It looks the players have checked out and just want to see the remainder of this season out. Kinda like us in the back of the last season."

They'd get everyone ahead of the ball... Then just run out of ideas and get tackled. Then their counter press was easily beat, and suddenly Bruno is sending our pacey players into space.\n\nBut still they had chances. They just have zero confidence."

We all knew he doesn't know how to organize a defense but not his fault that Chalobah and Fofana decided to put in braindead performances together.\n\nFofana especially proved that he cannot be trusted to lead the line, you cannot be so nonchalant leading the defense. The defense needs a Silva or Badiashile to keep it grounded.\n\nWe actually looked attacking wise and dominated the 1st half. Rather give playing time for younger players, winning is worthless now anyways."

                "comment": "We look timid so far, and I think a large part of that is down to the way we are set up. \n\nPotter has us playing a weird hybrid between a back 3 and back 4, with Cucu playing as a 3rd CB when Arsenal have the ball, and a defensive FB when we have the ball. Same thing follows for Mount, who's supposed to play on the left of the 3 behind Auba when we have the ball, and an inverted WB/3rd CM when we don't. What this does is every time we try to play out on the left side, we always seem to run in to trouble. Because Cucu is narrow and Mount is also narrow when we win the ball, we almost always have no one to play it to out wide. (This is also why you see Ben White on the ball in advanced areas, there's a load of space out wide on our left area) To this, you might say, well, play out from the right/through the middle.\n\nWith Arsenal's press, we cannot play through the middle. Their front 4 match up to our back 4, their pivot takes care of our pivot, which means we have to go out wide for the most part. Add to this the fact that RLC is a dribbler more than a passer, so he cannot help us pass our way through, and Jorginho alone cannot do that against Arsenal's high intensity press.\n\nWhat about the right? If you notice, most of our chances have come from the right, especially with link up between Sterling and Kai. This is no coincidence, but it does make our offensive play one-dimensional.\n\nOut of possession, because we are narrow and compact and have more men towards the center of the pitch, we are doing fine. However, because we are playing this hybrid system, a lot of times we turn over the ball around our area, we look in trouble because players are transitioning to their 'second' role.\n\nI have two solutions to this - one, switch Jorginho and RLC. Because RLC can dribble his way out of trouble, that should provide support to Mount, who can link up with him to move the ball forward. Not sure about the defensive implications though.\n\nThe second, and the one I prefer, is to commit to a back 3, have Cucu and RLC play WBs. For one, when we build up, Arsenal's front 4 have would be up against 5 of ours, which also helps relieve some of the pressure on Mendy. Since we cannot really play through the middle, having WBs should help tackle that problem too, while also allowing the left side of our attacking to function more 'normally'."

They lack all sorts of personality and drive. You then have players like. Silva and Azpilicueta seem to be the only ones who care about the shirt but they are in the twilight of their careers. Mount seems constantly lost. Sterling is a complete waste. Loftus Cheek looks paces behind everyone else.

Why not play 3 midfielders when it was obvious that was needed, complete disconnect between attack and defense. At what point does one give up on RLC, man has the skill but is hiding every game, never a risky pass or shot. Another jorginho? Pointless. Only kovacic looks good enough for chelsea at the moment. Real questions for potter now all that talk of dynamism but we get sitting back against arsenal at home and losing."

It's the reason why Arsenal are sitting well above them in the table when they have the talent to compete with them. I said the other week that Tottenham hadn't beaten a single good side this season and now I update that to include Liverpool. \n\nVs Newcastle - beaten 2 - 1 at home\n\nVs Man United - beaten 2 - 0 away\n\nVs Arsenal - beaten 3 - 1 away\n\nVs Chelsea - drew 2 - 2 away \n\nVs Liverpool - beaten 2 - 1 at home\n\nEvery other team they have played have been pretty shite and that is where all of their points come from. They're the total opposite of LFC who beat strong teams and lose to relegation squads. \n\nThey won't win anything playing this style of football and I honestly don't see them finishing top 3 or even 4 if they carry on like this. Newcastle are already above them and Chelsea, United and Liverpool will start to catch up in the second half of the season. They aren't as safe as some of their supporters may think."

Henderson, Wijnaldum, Milner, often dubbed the \u201cBrexit Midfield\u201d were perfect for this.\n\nCreativity came from two of the most creative players in the league (TAA, Robertson).\n\nEverybody was crying for more creativity in the midfield, and over the last couple of seasons, they\u2019ve got what they asked for. Elliot, Thiago, Carvalho, playmakers who can split the defence with a weighted through ball.\n\nWhat everybody is now discovering though, is that you can only have 11 players on the pitch. By playing these more creative midfielders, you have to sacrifice the hard working defenders. Without them, the whole system fails. The full backs are no longer protected, meaning they don\u2019t have as much freedom to create in the same way they did in the past, and in defence they are left exposed multiple times a game.\n\nLiverpool have moved away from a style, in a very subtle way, that got them to 3 champions league finals, and close to 100 points multiple times. One of the premier league\u2019s best ever sides. They failed to replace Wijnaldum, they failed to anticipate the decline of an aging Henderson and Milner, and have paid the price.\n\nBut I guess at least now they have some midfielders who can get assists, that\u2019s the most important thing, right?"

A bad look for Potter and Boehly, given how strong Tuchel made them off the bat. \n\nThis City was reminiscent of pre-Haaland City, outrageous domination from start to finish with 11 players strong in tight spaces who can execute a fluid and controlling gameplan. Outstanding. I liked what i saw of Alvarez, Pep has a head scratcher with this, Haaland looks great but City looks less dominant in the plays with him.\n\nHow good was that Sergio Gomez dribble in the first half? When Foden had a near miss from the cross. He completely played Chelsea's line and created a chance out of nothing. \n\nWhat a squad City has.. I feel it's their year in CL and i've never said this before. Team looks mature and Haaland will be very important for those bigger games."

What we're seeing here is the end result of Roman's itchy trigger finger over the past few years... Tuchel was papering over some serious cracks and then since Nov '21 it's just been one big downhill slide.\n\nPlayers like RLC and Chalobah just need to be moved on, they're not the type of backup you have when you're competing for a top position in the Premier League. Others like Ziyech, Havertz, Pulisic, Jorginho, Mendy, Gallagher... if offers came in for them I'd be tempted to sell to raise money for other buys. And just do whatever you can to be rid of Lukaku at this point... Build a team around the spine of James, Chilwell, Kova, Kante, Mount and some of the youth/others to challenge in a year or so's time."

They sacrificed one to form that huge overload in the middle with Rodri, Gundogan, Debruyne, and silva playing off eachother (it was like 60-70% possession?). Think he wanted more incision passes into Haaland, but it wasn't working out (think Debruyne plays a little more outwards to play in crosses to him normally, but he felt a lot closer to the middle).  \n\nBut when chelsea pressed that far right side with ziyech and hit city on the counter they def had the upper hand in terms of chances in the 1st half. Didn't help that cancelo / Foden weren't involved enough (less from Foden) and didnt stretch out chelsea enough. \n\n\nPep obviously knows what works and doesnt, akanji in and the kid lewis at rb(who was super good today). Mahrez and Grealish gave that width. Gave city a lot more control in those wide areas imo. Cucurella was sleeping/Mahrez got ahead of Grealish's pass. \n\nIdk how Potter should have responded to City's changes tbh. Chelsea were also unlucky, fucked by injuries, but atleast they saw sparks from: hall, zakaria, and Chukwuemeka."

But technically speaking Rashford does neither of these things. He doesn't touch the ball nor obstruct the vision of the defender. And if he did or not impact the ability of the defender to get the ball is debatable, as the defender itself slows down and doesn't really go challenge for the ball. Think the rule does need to become clearer for future reference tho."

But I'm really happy with this performance as we didn't give a lot of space to the like of Mahrez, Foden and De Bruyne while Haaland was completely ineffective which is due to Luke Shaw who's been excellent as a centre back.\n\nThe Bruno Fernandes goal definitely changed the game and City's game wasn't the same after that goal but if I had to be honest it shouldn't gave stood as Rashford was offside and he did interfere with play.\n\nI'm not sure if we're in a title race but I think its becoming more likely we will get top 4."

Lloris was a great keeper one of the best in the league at his best, but he\u2019s stuck around for a few more years than he should have. Ramsdale was mocked (I thought it was bad too) but Arteta knew we needed a modern keeper. Leno a great shot stopper but he\u2019s so poor at dealing with crosses and wasn\u2019t as comfortable on the ball. Today it showed arsenal were able to dominate the ball first half and play out from the back effectively also making a great save that probably saved the momentum, Lloris howler that gave us the momentum and spurs couldn\u2019t play out first half at all. \n\nAlso Harry Kane in north London derbies without pens is basically Chris wood, son was anonymous like he has been all this season, Kulu was their brightest player for sure the only real stand out. Happy we kept our cool in this heated game and finally won away."

It's amazing how a player can be scoring for fun at PSV, have a decent World Cup and then turn up in the Premier League looking completely devoid of all form and confidence.\n\nI'm sure Gakpo will improve as he settles in at Liverpool but at the same time he appears to be a completely unnecessary signing that might not get a look in once the Jota/Firmino/Diaz are back."

                "comment": "This was literally a mid-table bout between two sides that look like there's a lot of potential, but it's far from being realised.\n\nFirst about Liverpool:\n1. Yet again spectacular Alison, even with some poor cleanings of the ball. There was one situation I remember where Badiashille headed it from close after every player just let it pass them, cant do that.\n2. Defence was not good, without thinking too hard I remember Mudryk's situation where he was left completely alone, Chukwuemweka's situation at the end and Connor Galagher's situation where it was all blunders that saved us. Gomez from time to time looks like he can't focus to save his life and that is worry some considering that Van Dijk is also out of form.\n3. Keita is class and should start every game when he's healthy. Eliot playing on the left was weird and he was the worst on the field until he switched positions purely because he felt out of place. Bajcetic is... Decent, I'd love to rate him more but the guy hasn't shown anything outstanding. He has been quite neat on the ball though which is good.\n4. Nothing surprising from Salah who had a decent game but could have done much better in one or two situations. Gakpo I think played really well and moved well without the ball, found himself in good places with the ball but just like with Darwin - more is asked from the finishing touch. Nunez himself was class when he came back I think, as much as in one situation he should have passed rather than go on the left and shoot.\n\nFew things about Chelsea:\n1. The team feels like a career mode I'd have with Chelsea if I was 13 again. There's A LOT of players who are supposed to be really good, but which 11 exactly to put together, especially with all these injuries, is really a mystery right now.\n2. Mudryk, even with the biggest miss of the game, showed up massively in his first game in my opinion. The kid looked composed af, showed the sprint speed, showed the nice silky touch and good linkup play. What I liked from him is that once Carney tripped, he went and helped him to get up - I like intangibles in young players! The kid is cool as fuck, looks like a rapper and I think will flame up the league in the coming weeks.\n3. I like that Potter is patient with Connor Galagher. The guy is irrecognizable since coming back to Chelsea but the player he was at Palace is still there - and he would be a menace for this Chelsea side. I hope he makes it cuz I'm a fan of his.\n4. Thiago Silva... Just paying my respects as a football and defence fan to this walking legend.\n\n\nNot the best game of football and I could see why a neutral could be frustrated watching it, but as a liveproool fan and a Chelsea follower, it was good to see where the teams are currently. And that 'where' is 'fucked'."

He's not good defensively, doesn't control the pace of the match and kills every attacking play he gets his boots on, nothing but running in him, Aubameyang does nothing out there every week, Mount needs a break as his form is kind of a mess but there's noone to replace him atm...\n\nStill, one's starting to see what this team is supposed to do once James, Chilwell, Kant\u00e9 et al come back. Those 70 minutes in the middle of April will be glorious..."

But fuck me if I couldn't help but think how I would love to have a player like that at City. His dribbling, his speed and his technique instantly reminded me of Leroy Sane. \n\nI honestly don't know how Klopp can fix this. They are so easy to play through and the forwards just look so out of ideas. Even at the risk Bellingham going elsewhere next summer they need reinforcements now, not next summer."

Attacking play for Chelsea is still lacking but its better than before.\n\nIn midfield i would like to praise Jorginho who i don't like particularly much but he was great today. Hall finally playing the position he is supposed to play and Gallagher was a pressing machine again. Probably the 1st time in many games i'd say Kovacic was not missed.\n\nBadiashile was impressive yet again, He along with Fofana might be  good center back pairing for 4atb when Fofana is back. Koulibaly might actually be 2nd choice now. Cucarella had pretty hard job marking Salah's side but i think he managed,just.\n\nAttack was lacklustre again, I don't know what has happened to Mount. Maybe he needs a rest but he is just not there at the moment. Havertz no matter how much he is hated by the fanbase i feel is crucial player for attack, he is great at holding up the back, linking up plays and attacking interceptions. He was great in the 1st half i feel.\n\nlastly Mudryk, man how long has been that a  player with actual pace has played in attack. That dribble when he came on, haven't seen someone do that in close spaces since hazard.\n\nI can't help but feel a little excited for 11 Jan when Felix, James and Chilwell will be back."

United were extremely efficient and would have won against any other PL team today IMO, but that was just another example of how much Arsenal has improved this season. Weather Arsenal wins the league or not, they are on the right track for sucess, anyone who doesn't see it needs to rethink whatever they think they know about this sport. Onto the next one, FA Cup time, finally the first clash against City, curious what the line-ups will be, but one thing is for certain, Arsenal will play for the win, i hope we're having another great game on our hands.

Once Weghorst settles in it'll be interesting to see how his drawing defenders away affects Rashy. \n\nCons:\n\n* Wan-Bissaka being frustrating. One moment he plays like an absolute legend, the very next moment he lets Nketiah slide in front for that beautiful header. \n\n* Weghorst is drawing defenders, being an aerial threat, but hasn't been an impact striker. Maybe he just needs time.\n\n* Need more depth in the midfield. McTominay is not a good back up for Casemiro. It's like trading in a Rolls-Royce for Ford Focus. It works in a pinch, but not gonna feel the same.\n\nThough we had folks claiming title run after the City game, I'll be happy with a top 4 finish in th league with any one of Carabao Cup, FA Cup and UEL.\n\nSuch a close game against an almost unbeatable Arsenal without Casemiro brings back hope after so many years of disappointment! Having Arsenal's unbeaten run coinciding with our resurgence, having Liverpool and Chelsea back to being mid is just the perfect start to ~~2002~~ 2023!"

McTominay and AWB did slightly better than expected given the circumstances but were getting pulled out of position in ways I don't think Casemiro or Dalot might have. Still, not the end of the world and a lot to play for from United's perspective.\n\nArsenal pushed through and their resilience showed. If anyone deserved to win, it was them.

Casemiro was a huge loss as well, Arsenal found it ridiculously easy to progress the ball to our box all game. \n\nI think it\u2019s obvious that we have some players who just aren\u2019t at the required technical level to play Ten Hag\u2019s football.

Trossard's appearance was solid at the end there. Nketiah may not be Jesus but his work rate and persistence to get the finish are undeniable.

Zinchenko was IMMENSE particularly, only player that was calm throughout, and his driving runs and passing was vital to getting that winner. Saka was electric too, his goal was stunning. And I'm very happy for Nketiah, got his chance and he's developed really well as a striker, improved his finishing. What a massive win"

Confirmation bias kicks in because the better teams usually enjoy more possession and, when they eventually do convert it into goals (as they should), their patience is lauded. But nobody counts the goals impatience would have brought. City have looked more impatient in this half than at any time in weeks and far better for it in terms of outcomes and entertainment.\u201d\n\nCity in fact often give up making uncertain passes, risky and vertical plays that could result in a great chance to score, in the name of controlling the game, and avoiding giving the ball away to a counterattack. In a way, this reflects the evolution of football: quality above quantity, as embodied by the now popular xG stat. Watch a game from the 60s, 80s, 90s or 2000s, and you will see how football was much less refined because teams did far more truly ludicrous shots from outside the box and with very little chance of scoring, and far more vertical, long and direct passes with little chance of a player in your team managing to reach the ball or winnning the duel with the opponent. This evolution in football is good, but finding the balance between these approaches is very complicated in such a chaotic and unpredictable sport. I would say finding that balance is Guardiola's never-ending mission in his study of football. Same thing goes for Klopp. Any manager.\n\nLook at the play at 1:02 to 1:19 of the video below, from Milan vs. Napoli in the 1990/1991 Serie A season. I think it embodies what I say about old football. It is a great play that results in a great goal chance, but the ball went astray far more often than not though, making the game be less polished. You also notice this a lot if you watch 2000s Premier League games for example, and the average viewer did not care about stats like possession and percentage of accurate passes.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TnQ3i21_4lk"

Perisic was brought in to spam crosses into the box. No one's position on the team changed as much as Sonny's did during the offseason. You don't go from EPL golden boot winner to getting the least touches on the team.\r  \n\r  \nA good manager assesses the strengths of the team and makes the team work around him. Sonny's season hasn't been good but Spurs fans are deluding themselves if they think Sonny is the reason the season is panning out the way that it is. If anything, it's proved how much Spurs relied on Sonny previously and the manager needs to adjust to make it work."

Arsenal could also easily lose or draw to villa like city did Emery will be up for it, however I\u2019d expect arsenal to beat Everton at home. \n\nI know City haven\u2019t been at their best but looking at the games left I think they\u2019ll win it there\u2019s so long to go and arsenal have too many tough games. Just really need to hope we beat them and united home and spurs beat them to give us a good gap."

All competitions it\u2019s 1 clean sheet from 8 for Chelsea/Leicester. \u00a3200k a week\n\n\u00a357m on Marc Cucurella, one of the worst fullbacks I have seen in the division this season, a man who can barely make it 10 yards without tripping over his feet. A man who\u2019s won 8 games from the 26 he\u2019s played this season, losing 9 and keeping just 6 clean sheets. \u00a3175k a week, for a backup\n\n\u00a349m on Raheem Sterling, and while he\u2019s been decent, he\u2019s yet to hit 10 G/A in all competitions and we are almost in March. 4 from 17 in the league, but only 1 goal in his last 13 league games and even he hasn\u2019t been involved in a win in 2023, albeit from only 5 attempts. The wages are the issue here, he\u2019ll be taking \u00a316m a year until 2027\n\n\u00a333m on Kalidou Koulibaly, who Napoli have cashed in on at the perfect time. He has 1 clean sheet from his last last 6 league appearances, and has already lost 11 games in a Chelsea shirt. That\u2019s another \u00a3200k a week until he\u2019s 34\n\n\u00a310m for Aubameyang isn\u2019t bad, until you realize they\u2019re paying him \u00a3160k a week, for 3 goals in 19 appearances, and 1 goal contribution in his 13 in all comps. He\u2019s on the payroll until he\u2019s 35\n\n\u00a39m for Jo\u00e3o Felix on loan, with no option to buy, and paying \u00a3250k per week. He\u2019s made only 4 appearances for the club, scoring 1, and Chelsea have only scored twice and taken 1 point from the games he played. Not necessarily his fault, but not the game changer expected\n\n\u00a3105m on Enzo Fernandez, who is yet to win a match since signing an 8-year at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea scored only 1 goal in the process. \n\n\u00a361m+ for Mykhalo Mudryk, a man with 0 goals and 0 assists in 5 appearances for Chelsea, and like Enzo, yet to win a match in blue. The team have 1 goal in that timeframe, and barely featured in a dour 0-0 on his home debut. Nearly \u00a3100k for less than a season of experience\n\n\u00a330m for Noni Madueke, a more reasonable fee, however he has no goal contributions in his 3 appearances, and is yet another player yet to see his side win a match. Another 7 year deal as well\n\n\u00a310m on David Datro Fofana, only 3 appearances but sadly for the lad he\u2019s yet to even celebrate a goal on the pitch for anyone yet, his side outscored 0-2 in his time on the pitch\n\n\u00a322m for Potter and his staff from Brighton, for 5 league wins and 21 points from 18 games, and 2 wins from his last 15 league games. It gets even worse from an attacking perspective, only 16 scored in 18 games, and 3 scored in his last 10. Not to mention losing 4-1 to the team that he abandoned 6 games in\n\nBenoit Badiashile is the only real success here, \u00a333m and another fun 7 year contract. At least he got a win on his debut\n\n\nThis is honestly unprecedented levels of staggering failure, \u00a3490m spent on a champions league side, only to be languishing in 10th level on points with Aston Villa"

Rio was saying the biggest thing is can deal with being at a club like United, Ajax are huge but in terms of pressure United is different. Seems silly now but it was a genuine concern.\n\nI\u2019ve seen it time and time again at United, players that should have been good enough crumbling in that environment, managers too. It\u2019s the part of managing below that level can never teach you, it\u2019s in you or it\u2019s not.\n\nPotter is a small club man, and I don\u2019t mean that in a disrespectful way, but he\u2019s an underdog manager, he plays pretty decent football, he\u2019s good at getting talent out of cheap players and doing well.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of that just doesn\u2019t translate to the level of Chelsea, there\u2019s no trying at a club like that, there\u2019s no effort. It\u2019s binary. You win or you fail. Fans say they just want someone to play for the shirt but not at a club like that, yes you want that but if you\u2019re losing who cares.\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest issue for potter and this Chelsea team. It\u2019s not tactics or players or whatever (obviously all these ARE also factors) it\u2019s FEAR.\n\nTo me it looks like Potter goes out to try not to lose rather than to win, he\u2019s so scared of getting it wrong that he\u2019s paralysed. He can\u2019t make effective changes, he just wants to not lose and when you\u2019re at an underdog club, you can afford to be a bit like that lose 3, win 5 easy but at Chelsea? Not a chance.\n\nHe\u2019s a rabbit in the headlights at the moment."

The club had pretty much no pressure on them as they were never expected to flourish, and any time they did they were praised for it. Potter now has the complete opposite with an owner who genuinely has no idea about football and only knows how to make money. It's a horrible time to be the Chelsea manager and I do really believe that Potter is an absolutely fantastic manager with great ideas, but how on earth do you expect him to do anything with all the injuries he's had as well as the club forcing about 6 insanely high profile players into his club. \n\nThey should just be focused on next season now and should not spend any more in the summer unless it's a fantastic striker. They have the players, they just need to form them into some sort of team."

It was like watching Bayern defeat Barca 8-2 or Germany best Brazil 7-1, except these teams actually managed to score a goal or two to save face. Fair play to Salah and congrats for becoming the historic top goal scorer for liverpool in the premier league.\n\nLiverpool's effectives on goal was 100%. Manchester wasted so many easy chances in the first half that I knew they would conceed, but not 6 goals in 45 minutes. \n\nThe team has been on a winning streak recently and it finally won a trophy, but overconfidence is problematic. The greater the rise to glory, the more devastating the fall will be. ETH needs to sort things out. I love Weghorst and admire his passion for the club, but I feel like he lacks the ability. \n\nWasteful offence and leaky defence. Awful all around. I hope this is an outlier and the team will bounce back. Otherwise, it would be a terrible omen for future matches."

Hoping we get 30 mins of Nunez at least, Gakpo has been the least effective of our forwards. Jota has put in a real shift and looks great whenever he's on the ball. \n\nSurprisingly the midfield isn't doing TOO bad. KdB is still insane, the pass to start their goal was amazing, if lucky."

Robertson just looks tired. \n\nSalah got the goal, it's crazy but that was all he really did. Looked to be somewhat effective in the first half but offered nothing in the second. \n\nKlopp is at fault for quite a lot of this I think. Man plays 4.3.3 no matter what. Incredible coach, players love him, obviously instils his beliefs in his players, but has zero flexibility as a coach. \n\nCity were phenomenal. The whole team really. Stones looks great in midfield, Grealish and Mahrez ran riot. Alvarez is wasted in City. He will never start over Haaland and is far too good to sit on the bench. Would love to have him at United.

Think that cost us. \n\nMaybe would have put Trossard on earlier, but difficult to chose who to take off for him.\n\na point at anfield isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world but i think we were even lucky to take that.

Konate took on the responsibility of backing up Trent as Trent switched the passage of play/drew out Arsenal players to give as much space to Salah as possible. However the first 30 mins of build up play from liverpool was just awful. Arsenal were man to man for most of the press and just hammered liverpool down (idk why tbh, nerves? Trent not running back fast enough as he was tied to the midfield?) Regardless two goals conceded both from arsenals wingers that forced liverpool to shift their defense awkwardly. \n\nAfter the Xhaka Trent incident, liverpool woke up and Arsenal went silent. We finally got shades of the previous lfc: bobby coming in and making a statement, Konate defending like a beast, Trent's attacking game on point, etc. (I'm definitely not bias lol). \n\nFinally idk why Arsenal wanted to just sit in a low block and just attack on the transition after that incident. Why? Lfc were still extremely vulnerable, especially on the right as Trent was dedicated to joining the midfield and pushing higher up. In the first half, Arsenals typical inverted full back tactic with zinchenko helped overload the fullbacks (with the CM's making runs). Why forfeit this? It seems that they were content with the result even tho they knew lfc were close to and probably should have gotten a third. \n\nI'm glad we tied against Arsenal but I'm still rooting for them. However its gonna be difficult asf. City are now on their run of form where they magically get better at this point in the year. We all knew it was gonna happen. Arsenal can't afford to drop anything. They need to dig deep and win. The game against City will be the title defining game. They can't afford to play like they did in the second half."

You can't buckle the way they did when you're chasing a title.\n\nOdegaard, Saka and Partey didn't come out for the second half.

During that window Liverpool were utterly RELENTLESS.\n\nTierney should\u2019ve been bought on for Zinchenko slightly sooner as well; maybe that would\u2019ve prevented the goal too. \n\nOn paper, a draw at Anfield is a good result; but losing 2 points after being two goals up in the first half will surely sting.\n\nThe commentators on Disney+ Hotstar were incessantly jinxing Arsenal. When Salah scored the commentator seemed as relieved as a man who finds out his mistress\u2019 pregnancy report came back negative.

Tottenham and Manchester United have laid out the blueprint for overcoming City, and its largely down to sitting deep and hitting them on the counter. We refuse to do this at all for some reason.\n\nFor the life of me I have no idea why arteta thought we could outfight them, especially with saliba out injured. So many times City got behind our backline because we refused to sit in and it was only ramsdale heroics that kept the score from being truly embarrassing."

We had an amazing run with a bright and young squad but the gulf in quality in the run in to the final stretch has shown the difference. With every competition we\u2019ve dropped out of, we fans have told ourselves it\u2019s ok bc now we can focus more on the league. Well even with cup and Europa pressures off our backs we still squandered it while City are lined up for a treble. This is the true reality of our level. We have an amazing squad to develop and keep pushing, but today we were shown where we stand in the hierarchy. Plenty to shed a tear and be proud of, CL is back on, and we have building blocks for success. We Move!"

Yes, their premier league title winning chances now look critically jeopardized, but it is still technically attainable if Murphy and his law have anything to do with the rest of the season! Unlikely as it now looks, Arsenal can still win this! But if indeed they do fail to ascend the summit first, as now looks probable, when the disappointment of \"what so nearly could've been\" finally settles, there is a lot that the Gunners will be able to look back on with pride, and look forward to with hope, assuming the next moves made are good.\n\nFocusing on the future, the decisions Arsenal make in the summer recess will be critical to their fortunes going forward. It is easy to rest on laurels and fall off a cliff at this point, as Brendan Rogers, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and Claudio Ranieri all know very well. The one thing the Gunners must not do, is allow themselves to fall into the trap of thinking they came really close this year, so only minor tweaks are required to overtake City next year. That would be a huge mistake to make! Arsenal have serious issues where quality in depth is concerned. To put it mildly, Arsenal have no depth of any great consequence, and it takes way too few absences from Arteta's favourite XI, to render his otherwise world class first team, bang average. They did well enough without Jesus for a spell, but Saliba's absence has been telling. Can anyone imagine how much worse Arsenal would be without any one of Odergaard, Partey,, Martinelli, Saka, Ramsdale, or White as well?!  The work required in the summer is clear - sell the poor and average, replace with proven title-winning mettle, and highly promising quality talent. This is where the club's sporting ambition must show, and anything less than serious investment on a rebuild/overhaul scale will be a boon for the likes of my beloved Red Devils, and Citeh. If Araenal are not bidding for the likes of Jude Bellingham, Pedri, Gavi, Musiala and Osimhen, they are missing the point by a galactic mile. Oh, and Arsenal had better reinforce Arteta's contract, even if it was only extended last year. When Real Madrid come calling... and they will, he will need way more reasons to stay than he already has, especially if Arsenal don't improve his squad in the summer!"

Arsenal played extremely poor while City absolutely battered them. \n\nInteresting that for this game City played their more traditional setup with a back 4, 2 pivots, and de bruyne as a CAM. Rather, in other games they would play a back three with stones as an inverted fullback going into the middle to form a box midfield.\n\nThis game for City was all about possession. For as good as Pep's Barca were (the best in history imo) this type of possession based game is the most defensive style you can employ. Holding onto the ball and calmly moving it about, you take less risks. You need good players to pull this off tho. However in this situation, Arsenal's positioning and press were completely ineffective. It was ridiculous imo. Organized Pressing is how you beat City's possession style. Ur fighting for the title, you need to get off ur ass and press both intelligently and with urgency. There was none of that when City were knocking about the ball. I'm sure City was gonna play this way initially, but the first goal solidified that style of play and dictated the rest of the game. \n\nHaalands and KDBs link up play this game was fantastic. For each of City's goals they took Arsenals weak press out of the game and played inbetween the lines to find either of these two players. Haaland's hold up play in particular was really good this game. He won all of his battles against Holding. Taking him out of his position and creating huge holes for KDB to run into. I've been really scathing of Arsenal in this post, but its unfortunately warranted. The players were genuinely poor. \n\nPrem teams usually play this suicidal high defensive line. It's great since you can press higher and win the ball higher up. However you CAN'T LEAVE HOLES. Haaland's hold up play + looming runners proved why it's suicidal. Partey as the single pivot had too much to cover, and while Zinchenko can act as a second pivot the threat of silva/walker is always looming (not so much this game tho), he switched back to a traditional fullback in the second half.\n\n**Amateur opinon:** \n\nIf I was Arteta, I would have probably put Jorghino on as soon as the second half started to help out Partey. You needed two acting CDMs to cover the midfield while watching KDB/Haalands looming presence. As well as to progress the ball (as Arsenal didn't throughout the game). \n\nIt was a good year for Arsenal tho. They've massively improved over the years and have a good coach in Arteta. If I had to give Arsenal a pass, this City team is the best Pep has ever had. They however need to improve their mentality if they want to compete in the future. Easier said than done, but it's gotta be done if you want to beat this monstrous City team."

He saw that against Liverpool.  He saw it happen against West Ham and he saw it happen against Southampton.\n\nThe last 4-5 years, when Pep has gone to Anfield, their biggest rivals in the 2-horse races we've had between them, City played completely differently, and respected the ***massive*** threat posed to them by Liverpool.\n\nArteta coming to City's ground, thinking the team can play the same was as they do with Saliba even ***if*** he was in the team, would've been somewhat naive.  To do it with Rob Holding? Nah.  That's just insane.\n\nIf we'd have drawn tonight, yes, it would mathematically be in City's hands but we'd only be hoping for one draw in their last 7 for that to change.  Now?  No chance."

Partey should have definitely been off at half time.\n\nI understand having faith, and I understand hindsight is 20/20, but the truth is in the results. Sloppy passing, tired legs, nerves.\n\nWhat can I say? For a minute I thought we could win the league as the second best team. Now I\u2019ll have to be happy eventually being behind a clearly dominate city squad.\n\nThere was a window where pep was trying to reinvent football again and we could\u2019ve snaked it. Oh well. This is a long term project and we\u2019re showing improvement, even with hiccups.  I just hope they keep learning and we do this again next season with fewer mistakes, and the inevitable ones that hopefully cost less."

One small thing changes in one match (either by City, Liverpool in past seasons, or Arsenal this season) and City don\u2019t win the title. They aren\u2019t unbeatable. You can\u2019t drop 9 points out of 12 and say that you never had a chance.\n\nAlso people saying this era of City winning every year will never end grossly underestimate Pep\u2019s influence on this team.

Since that game Liverpool have played Spurs 11 times (including today) and not lost once.  \n\nLiverpool have actually only lost to Spurs once since 2012. That is one loss in their last 23 matches against Spurs.  In their last 23 matches against Spurs, Liverpool have 16 wins, 6 draws and 1 loss.  The results have dramatically been in favour of Liverpool in the last 10 years.\n\nSpurs hit the woodwork again a few times today, but they always seem to do that against Liverpool, come close to scoring but just seem to always fall short of doing enough to get the 3 pts.\n\nSpurs have won at Anfield in the League only twice in the Prem era and only 8 times ever in all comps (89 matches played). So their wins at Anfield are pretty rare occasions.\n\nSalah now has 9 goals in 13 matches against Spurs since joining Liverpool, and Van Dijk has played against Spurs 9 times for Liverpool without defeat. Salah's goal today was Liverpool's first penalty they have scored in the Prem this season. Salah missed the other two pens they have got.\n\nKane himself has scored 9 goals against Liverpool, but only has 1 win in 17 appearances and 10 defeats.\n\nLiverpool in 5th now with their 4th consecutive Prem win.  Probably too few games left to finish in the Top 4, but we'll see what happens."

Holding is done though. That hair will be moved on in the summer.\n\nChelsea? Clueless from top to bottom, from inside to outside, from tip to taint.

It isn't a surprise how bad they are tonight, but it still remains absolutely staggering how bad they are tonight.

Half an hour in, Lampard gave Tariq Lamptey his Chelsea debut and took the experienced player Emerson off. Lamptey bossed it and helped lead the comeback. Tammy Abraham, Fikyao Tomori, Mason Mount, Reece James, Callum Hudson-Odoi all played in that match. Now Chukwuemeka can't make the match day squad, Lewis Hall played a meaningless friendly against Monaco U21s today. \n\n6 consecutive defeats. 2 goals scored. Those who \"deserve to play\" are failing while those who have to \"earn their spot\" are being neglected for literally zero reason other than trying to save face. Lampard had a prime opportunity to at least galvanize the fan base with what made his first tenure so fun and he's botched it so spectacularly and fielded a team made up of majority players who have been searching for the exit door the minute the last game is over. \n\nHe can draw a line with Joao Felix but Sterling, Kovacic can still roam around the pitch not giving any effort or fucking up for the 100th time in 10 minutes and he sees nothing wrong with that. Play the washed up corpse of Cesar Azpilicueta but not Chalobah. \n\nNone of this makes sense. It's all infuriating. This summer is so, so important like you wouldn't believe."

He\u2019s been beaten/ turned the ball over far too many times lately. KT needs a run out. \n\nChelsea players need to refund their fans. That was a spineless performance.
