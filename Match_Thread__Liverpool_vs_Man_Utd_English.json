I get that he gets tons of goals and assists but idk\n\nEdit- ik he was kinda poor but wouldn't Casemiro be better? Or varane? Even Shaw ig? Idk i don't watch united religiously obv only in big matches but i fail to believe there's no one in the starting 11 with better leadership qualities. Trust me as an arsenal fan I've seen what poor captains can do or just giving it to the most popular player or your star. Something for ten hag to think about i suppose."

It was like watching Bayern defeat Barca 8-2 or Germany best Brazil 7-1, except these teams actually managed to score a goal or two to save face. Fair play to Salah and congrats for becoming the historic top goal scorer for liverpool in the premier league.\n\nLiverpool's effectives on goal was 100%. Manchester wasted so many easy chances in the first half that I knew they would conceed, but not 6 goals in 45 minutes. \n\nThe team has been on a winning streak recently and it finally won a trophy, but overconfidence is problematic. The greater the rise to glory, the more devastating the fall will be. ETH needs to sort things out. I love Weghorst and admire his passion for the club, but I feel like he lacks the ability. \n\nWasteful offence and leaky defence. Awful all around. I hope this is an outlier and the team will bounce back. Otherwise, it would be a terrible omen for future matches."
