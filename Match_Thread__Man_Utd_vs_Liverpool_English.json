Varane, Martinez and Malacia were the stand-out performers for me. \nAnd Martinez, my man! Hope the appreciation is as loud as the trolling. Man just threw himself around and killed for the ball. He\u2019s got that dawg in him you know.\n\nMuch needed win to lighten the atmosphere around the club and get some momentum going forward."
