Right now Saliba is one of the best defenders in the Premier League and he's  so comfortable with playing out in the back which means Saliba is pretty much press resistant\n\nJesus work rate was incredible in the match and the Spurs defence couldn't deal with him. You could tell that he's happy to be the main man."

Ref was shit all day imo. Son and Kane need to find form quick for spurs, counter attack and sit back is not gonna be good for them long term.  Thought we were really good today, Partey is just so damn composed and smooth. Saka wasn\u2019t super impactful, but as soon as he wasn\u2019t double marked, the second goal happened. Need Martinelli to be more lethal in his finishing, he could\u2019ve had 2 today. Saliba was class. I was interested to see how he matched up against Kane/son."
