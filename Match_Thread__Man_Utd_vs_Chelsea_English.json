In my Wednesday kick about, I often tell my team to finish any move with a shot, because at the very least if it goes wide or the keeper makes a save, you have time to reset and not get countered.\n\nBut Chelsea kept commiting men forward, having possession in the final third. They'd get everyone ahead of the ball... Then just run out of ideas and get tackled. Then their counter press was easily beat, and suddenly Bruno is sending our pacey players into space.\n\nBut still they had chances. They just have zero confidence."

While Tuchel might have not been fighting for top 4, you can bet your house that he would be breaking 50 points. Now they have deadwood for a decade, ruined Potters career, ruined what's left of their most important player's managerial career, and have to hire a limited coach who is their rivals darling. They even bought Aubameyang and STILL have Lukaku on the payroll lmao.\n\nIf they had stopped, been patient, and evaluated for even a second, this entire season and all their future issues could have been minimized or even avoided"

We all knew he doesn't know how to organize a defense but not his fault that Chalobah and Fofana decided to put in braindead performances together.\n\nFofana especially proved that he cannot be trusted to lead the line, you cannot be so nonchalant leading the defense. The defense needs a Silva or Badiashile to keep it grounded.\n\nWe actually looked attacking wise and dominated the 1st half. Rather give playing time for younger players, winning is worthless now anyways."

I understand players can develop overtime, and he is young enough that he still has room for improvement, but buying a player that doesn't fit the system and shoehorning him in doesn't do him any favors, nor does it do the players surrounding him any favors.  \n\nGoing to Arsenal would've been a much better move for him, and while he wouldn't necessarily be starting every game, he'd be in a system that utilizes wingers much, much better than any system Chelsea has used."
