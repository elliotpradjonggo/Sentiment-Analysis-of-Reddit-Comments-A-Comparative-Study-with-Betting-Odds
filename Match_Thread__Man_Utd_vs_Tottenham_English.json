Without question our best performance under Ten Hag, I haven\u2019t seen us play that well for a full 90 minutes in years. \n\nHard to single anyone out for praise but Casemiro and Fred stood out to me. They dominated the midfield and their games compliment one another so well. Casemiro\u2019s calmness and positioning in midfield always sticks out to me."

The best players look like they've never played with each other and I'm not entirely sure what's causing it\n\nA very, very deserved win for United. \n\nFred and Bruno had control of that midfield and Casemiro held it down on his own. \n\nMartinez and Varane kept Kane and Son extremely quiet.

Utd were superb and constantly left spurs players in their wake, but won't have an easier day in terms of build up and the first phase, they maintained attacks well especially in the 2nd half."

Very lucky to only concede 2.\n\nGreat display from United and have not seen them properly dominate and put away chances where it counts in a very long time too. Fred and Casemiro absolutely ran the show, and ironically Conte's 3 man midfield looked completely lost against them."

Best United performance I\u2019ve seen in a long time. \n\nConte is a great manager but I\u2019m so confused that he didn\u2019t change shape or make subs until the 80th minute. Terrible all over the pitch, but especially in defence and midfield, they couldn\u2019t get the ball out, suppose credit is due to United because they were all over them pressing. \n\nUnited dicked them for 90 minutes basically, Ronaldo still tried to make it about himself by leaving early as well \ud83e\udd23"
