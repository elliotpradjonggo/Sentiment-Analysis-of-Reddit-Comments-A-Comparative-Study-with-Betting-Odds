But technically speaking Rashford does neither of these things. He doesn't touch the ball nor obstruct the vision of the defender. And if he did or not impact the ability of the defender to get the ball is debatable, as the defender itself slows down and doesn't really go challenge for the ball. Think the rule does need to become clearer for future reference tho."

But I'm really happy with this performance as we didn't give a lot of space to the like of Mahrez, Foden and De Bruyne while Haaland was completely ineffective which is due to Luke Shaw who's been excellent as a centre back.\n\nThe Bruno Fernandes goal definitely changed the game and City's game wasn't the same after that goal but if I had to be honest it shouldn't gave stood as Rashford was offside and he did interfere with play.\n\nI'm not sure if we're in a title race but I think its becoming more likely we will get top 4."

I like players being a little tricky and clever"
