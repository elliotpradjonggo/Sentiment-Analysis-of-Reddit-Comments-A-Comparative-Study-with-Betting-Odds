time,comments, Arsenal, Man Utd
2023-01-22 12:02:34,Crazy too think that Arsenal is at this level with how young their list is. The Young Guns are definitely here,1,0
2023-01-22 13:35:11,trosard was cooking at the end,1,0
2023-01-22 13:34:06,What a game from Zinchenko and Lisandro,1,0
2023-01-22 11:23:22,If I was Man Utd, I'd simply field Casemiro. What are they gonna do, call the football's cops?,-1,1
2023-01-22 12:00:23,Fantastic match so far, really feels back to the old United-Arsenal days,1,1
2023-01-22 11:27:06,I love how we get the sky bet advert, a little introduction to Fergie and Beckham and then we get a bet365 advert. Hopefully there’s another betting advert before kick off. I’d hate for the betting companies to not have enough advertising slots.,0,0

2023-01-22 14:31:56,Watching Ten Hag's post match interview, he is being a bit harsh on his own team. Arsenal forced the mistakes, like Man U forced Partey, Saka and Ramsdale for their mistakes on their goals,1,-1
"2023-01-22 12:04:01,Saka: ""2 times! He did it 2 times!"" Arteta: ""4th time! He did it 4 times!"",1,0"
2023-01-22 13:29:45,United fan. That was a great game of football and Arsenal the better team overall. But fuck me did I enjoy that, dark winter evening and Arsenal and United fighting over a match that means something. It's like it's 2001 again,1,1
2023-01-22 13:31:21,Been very very anxious then euphoric. Zinchenko is unreal, you can tell he has the champion quality. Eddie missed chance (also stupidly give DDG the reason to stall) but he stepped up when it counts. Saka and Rashford two unreal goals. Not the best game for some of our players but just like Arteta said, we support each other on the pitch, and got a win, I hope this game can boost our confidence massively. What a game,1,1
2023-01-22 12:20:57,Proper Arsenal x United battle. Haven't had these in what feels like forever.,1,1
2023-01-22 12:46:25,Somewhere, Gareth Southgate is in a room, watching Rashford and Saka fire in screamers, trying to figure out how he clone Sterling to play left and right wing,1,0
2023-01-22 13:28:34,De gea easily saves that touch from Nketiah if Eddie hadn't violently ripped de gea's arm off his body just a few minutes earlier /s,0,-1
2023-01-22 16:48:08,Ødegaard is on another lvl. Jesus his technique is outstanding. That pass to Xhaka that got intercepted by Martinez is amazing,1,0
2023-01-22 13:29:16,The best team won. Utd have done the best they possibly could with the personnel and mid week fixture. Would have liked to see Garnacho come on earlier but I can understand the preference is to secure a point at that stage. Gutted to have lost points in the last minutes two games in a row.,1,-1
2023-01-22 13:12:16,Trossard looks like he's permanently just woken up from a bender,0,0
2023-01-22 13:30:40,Trossard got that over the line. Fucking incredible win,1,0
2023-01-22 12:18:30,I liked Shaw better when he was shit,0,0
2023-01-22 14:15:14,Arsenal are so good in tight spaces, against a low block. Really impressive,1,0
2023-01-22 11:49:01,That was pretty shocking from Partey though... Made 3 errors in the space of a few seconds.... Pretty uncharacteristic for this season,-1,0
2023-01-22 12:43:06,Saka is genuinely a top top quality player. Everything about his physicality, control, end product and intelligence. I legitimately believe he's underrated (obviously not like hugely, but you get the idea),1,0
2023-01-22 11:49:47,Christ alive who put that fake tan on Ben white,0,0
2023-01-22 11:46:27,People get so salty in these thread it’s actually mad,-1,0

2023-01-22 13:23:53,Damn Trossard?????,0,0
2023-01-22 13:25:53,This felt like retro arsenal vs United - what a game!,1,1
2023-01-22 13:29:02,Fair play to Nketiah. Thought he'd pulled down Arsenal's trousers by getting a six figure a week contract, but he's probably already paid them back. His all round game has really developed in such a short space of time.,1,0
2023-01-22 18:20:27,Still buzzing from this, proper match this was,1,0
2023-01-22 13:55:23,I love how this Arsenal just edges opponents regardless of name super exciting this game kind of proves Arsenal will be there by end of season,1,0
2023-01-22 13:35:46,United looked extremely dangerous anytime they got the ball. I think the full backs did well, but Weghorst is not the man for the job.,0,1
2023-01-22 11:26:05,Ferguson is in the crowd and that guy from Arsenal can't be arsed to show up. Smh.,-1,0

2023-01-22 13:24:15,Trossard looks great,1,0
2023-01-22 13:26:57,trossard might be a title winning signing,1,0
2023-01-22 13:27:00,What a game. Good one arsenal! Deserve to win the league,1,0
2023-01-22 13:29:03,Excellent game. The goal was coming tbh, Utd backs against the wall for about half-an-hour and just lumping it forward, a bit of a reality check too, for the whole team and a few individuals. Deserved win for Arsenal.,1,-1
2023-01-22 12:14:44,[deleted],0,0
"2023-01-22 13:59:43,Great effort from Utd, the development in 6 months is staggering. Starting to see that players like McTominay have no place in the squad anymore, which is obviously part of the rebuild. He was really, really poor today. You simply CANNOT be passive as a ""defensive"" midfielder in the way that he is.,0,1"
2023-01-22 11:19:48,If lose: We were missing Casemiro and referee was Anthony Taylor If win: Expected, massive club,-1,1
2023-01-22 11:32:57,Goddamn Arsenal play beautifully.,1,0
2023-01-22 12:19:41,Good half, Shaw has been matching Saka stride for stride Mr Airpods is gonna have to tweak the tactics a bit Rashford is genuinely scary, Nketiah is a man possessed All to play for in the second half, Love it Proper Arsenal v United,1,1
2023-01-22 13:30:10,That 2nd half was giving me PTSD flashbacks of last season. Arsenal were the better team, United has work to do yet. Exciting match despite not the result I hoped for!,1,0
2023-01-22 13:30:36,Fair enough, Arsenal deserved the win, we weren't playing to win in the end and you just felt that goal coming. Would've preferred a draw ofc for the point! Probably one of ( if not ) the most exciting/fun games to watch this season!,1,0
2023-01-22 15:16:10,It's a pleasure trusting the process,1,0
2023-01-22 13:28:48,Love this Arsenal side! Lots of fight in them, they don't seem dazed or confused no matter what the score is!,1,0

2023-01-22 12:43:39,Saka is one of the most likable players in the league,1,0
2023-01-23 00:39:00,Instant classic, what an incredible game with an incredible ending. Nketiah really stepped up, the whole team really stepped up!,1,0
2023-01-22 13:07:40,whatever happens, it's nice to finally see this fixture have a meaningful impact on the title race again lmao,1,1

2023-01-22 13:33:24,Zinchenko motm surely?,1,0
2023-01-22 13:41:30,What a match, we've come a long way, still a long way to go. Would have been nice to see what this would have ended up with Case on the pitch but fair play to Arsenal they never gave up.,1,0

2023-01-22 13:16:19,Thoughts and prayers to De Gea. Get well soon.,0,-1
2023-01-22 13:28:16,Credit to United, they sure made themselves tough to beat today - but Arsenal always deserved all the points today. Not even a similar amount of chances. Better team for basically the entire match. Glad we stuck to our game, kept pushing and found that bit of earned fortune in the end.,1,-1
2023-01-22 12:00:45,Martinez is great. Doesn't look like he should be able to perform at CB but he's just a constant pain in there and makes his presence felt. Reminds me of Puyol.,1,0
2023-01-22 12:09:36,If Arteta gets sent off here, Richard Keys is going to orgasm like he's pumping his daughters best mate.,0,0
2023-01-22 13:29:33,Fuck I’m happy… reminiscent of old age rivalry which was the best in England. Hope we get more of those for years to come,1,1
2023-01-22 13:16:07,So infuriating that this is even allowed. Why can players lie down for 2 minutes after what is blatantly obviously a painless soft touch,-1,0
2023-01-22 13:24:12,GG Arsenal.. Well Deserved. United Players looked tired af in the half. Still the better team won.,1,-1

2023-01-22 13:34:37,Fuck me I am absolutely buzzing, what a game!,1,0
2023-01-22 12:27:40,Pretty intense game, which is exactly what it should be given the form of the teams and the table. As long as it doesn’t get over refereed with a bullshit sending off in the second half it’s going to be a huge second half. I can see a controversy coming, always is.,0,0
2023-01-22 12:43:09,De Gea shouldn't have said those statements knowing he might concede a screamer by either Saka or ødegaard.,0,-1

2023-01-22 13:28:37,Honestly as a United fan, this is one of those matches where I ain't mad we lost. I would have taken a draw but nah, fair play to Arsenal. What a team, Odegaard and Saka are out of this world this season. Rather Arsenal than the scum to win the league,0,1
