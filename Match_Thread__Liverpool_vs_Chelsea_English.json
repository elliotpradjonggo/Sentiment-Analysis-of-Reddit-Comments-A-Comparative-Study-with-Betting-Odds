Same can't be said of Gakpo who was generally pretty shite. It's amazing how a player can be scoring for fun at PSV, have a decent World Cup and then turn up in the Premier League looking completely devoid of all form and confidence.\n\nI'm sure Gakpo will improve as he settles in at Liverpool but at the same time he appears to be a completely unnecessary signing that might not get a look in once the Jota/Firmino/Diaz are back."

Yet again spectacular Alison, even with some poor cleanings of the ball. There was one situation I remember where Badiashille headed it from close after every player just let it pass them, cant do that.\n2. Defence was not good, without thinking too hard I remember Mudryk's situation where he was left completely alone, Chukwuemweka's situation at the end and Connor Galagher's situation where it was all blunders that saved us. Gomez from time to time looks like he can't focus to save his life and that is worry some considering that Van Dijk is also out of form.\n3. Keita is class and should start every game when he's healthy. Eliot playing on the left was weird and he was the worst on the field until he switched positions purely because he felt out of place. Bajcetic is... Decent, I'd love to rate him more but the guy hasn't shown anything outstanding. He has been quite neat on the ball though which is good.\n4. Nothing surprising from Salah who had a decent game but could have done much better in one or two situations. Gakpo I think played really well and moved well without the ball, found himself in good places with the ball but just like with Darwin - more is asked from the finishing touch. Nunez himself was class when he came back I think, as much as in one situation he should have passed rather than go on the left and shoot.\n\nFew things about Chelsea:\n1. The team feels like a career mode I'd have with Chelsea if I was 13 again. There's A LOT of players who are supposed to be really good, but which 11 exactly to put together, especially with all these injuries, is really a mystery right now.\n2. Mudryk, even with the biggest miss of the game, showed up massively in his first game in my opinion. The kid looked composed af, showed the sprint speed, showed the nice silky touch and good linkup play. What I liked from him is that once Carney tripped, he went and helped him to get up - I like intangibles in young players! The kid is cool as fuck, looks like a rapper and I think will flame up the league in the coming weeks.\n3. I like that Potter is patient with Connor Galagher. The guy is irrecognizable since coming back to Chelsea but the player he was at Palace is still there - and he would be a menace for this Chelsea side. I hope he makes it cuz I'm a fan of his.\n4. Thiago Silva... Just paying my respects as a football and defence fan to this walking legend.\n\n\nNot the best game of football and I could see why a neutral could be frustrated watching it, but as a liveproool fan and a Chelsea follower, it was good to see where the teams are currently. And that 'where' is 'fucked'."

He's not good defensively, doesn't control the pace of the match and kills every attacking play he gets his boots on, nothing but running in him, Aubameyang does nothing out there every week, Mount needs a break as his form is kind of a mess but there's noone to replace him atm...\n\nStill, one's starting to see what this team is supposed to do once James, Chilwell, Kant\u00e9 et al come back.

His dribbling, his speed and his technique instantly reminded me of Leroy Sane. \n\nI honestly don't know how Klopp can fix this. They are so easy to play through and the forwards just look so out of ideas. Even at the risk Bellingham going elsewhere next summer they need reinforcements now, not next summer."

Attacking play for Chelsea is still lacking but its better than before.\n\nIn midfield i would like to praise Jorginho who i don't like particularly much but he was great today. Hall finally playing the position he is supposed to play and Gallagher was a pressing machine again. Probably the 1st time in many games i'd say Kovacic was not missed.\n\nBadiashile was impressive yet again, He along with Fofana might be  good center back pairing for 4atb when Fofana is back. Koulibaly might actually be 2nd choice now. Cucarella had pretty hard job marking Salah's side but i think he managed,just.\n\nAttack was lacklustre again, I don't know what has happened to Mount. Maybe he needs a rest but he is just not there at the moment. Havertz no matter how much he is hated by the fanbase i feel is crucial player for attack, he is great at holding up the back, linking up plays and attacking interceptions. He was great in the 1st half i feel.\n\nlastly Mudryk, man how long has been that a  player with actual pace has played in attack. That dribble when he came on, haven't seen someone do that in close spaces since hazard.\n\nI can't help but feel a little excited for 11 Jan when Felix, James and Chilwell will be back."
