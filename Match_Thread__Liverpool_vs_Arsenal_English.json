Think that cost us. \n\nMaybe would have put Trossard on earlier, but difficult to chose who to take off for him.\n\na point at anfield isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world but i think we were even lucky to take that. I think had we not tried to park the bus and played to our strengths then we\u2019d have had a better chance of winning"

            "comment": "Very fun game to watch. \n\nIt was really interesting to see Klopps change to Trents positioning as he was a lot more inverted this game and acted as the second pivot. Konate took on the responsibility of backing up Trent as Trent switched the passage of play/drew out Arsenal players to give as much space to Salah as possible. However the first 30 mins of build up play from liverpool was just awful. Arsenal were man to man for most of the press and just hammered liverpool down (idk why tbh, nerves? Trent not running back fast enough as he was tied to the midfield?) Regardless two goals conceded both from arsenals wingers that forced liverpool to shift their defense awkwardly. \n\nAfter the Xhaka Trent incident, liverpool woke up and Arsenal went silent. We finally got shades of the previous lfc: bobby coming in and making a statement, Konate defending like a beast, Trent's attacking game on point, etc. (I'm definitely not bias lol). \n\nFinally idk why Arsenal wanted to just sit in a low block and just attack on the transition after that incident. Why? Lfc were still extremely vulnerable, especially on the right as Trent was dedicated to joining the midfield and pushing higher up. In the first half, Arsenals typical inverted full back tactic with zinchenko helped overload the fullbacks (with the CM's making runs). Why forfeit this? It seems that they were content with the result even tho they knew lfc were close to and probably should have gotten a third. \n\nI'm glad we tied against Arsenal but I'm still rooting for them. However its gonna be difficult asf. City are now on their run of form where they magically get better at this point in the year. We all knew it was gonna happen. Arsenal can't afford to drop anything. They need to dig deep and win. The game against City will be the title defining game. They can't afford to play like they did in the second half."

Did well to get under Xhaka's skin.\n\nGood second half from Liverpool.\n\nAaron Ramsdale heroics saved Arsenal. You can't buckle the way they did when you're chasing a title.\n\nOdegaard, Saka and Partey didn't come out for the second half.

During that window Liverpool were utterly RELENTLESS.\n\nTierney should\u2019ve been bought on for Zinchenko slightly sooner as well; maybe that would\u2019ve prevented the goal too. \n\nOn paper, a draw at Anfield is a good result; but losing 2 points after being two goals up in the first half will surely sting.\n\nThe commentators on Disney+ Hotstar were incessantly jinxing Arsenal. When Salah scored the commentator seemed as relieved as a man who finds out his mistress\u2019 pregnancy report came back negative. And they were so keen on rounding off the 6 point lead that exists currently, they almost handed City the title at the end of full time tonight.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of hope that we can still win the League from this point onwards.
