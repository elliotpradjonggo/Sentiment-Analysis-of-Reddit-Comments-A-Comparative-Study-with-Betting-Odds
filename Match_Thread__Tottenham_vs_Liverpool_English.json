It's the reason why Arsenal are sitting well above them in the table when they have the talent to compete with them. I said the other week that Tottenham hadn't beaten a single good side this season and now I update that to include Liverpool. \n\nVs Newcastle - beaten 2 - 1 at home\n\nVs Man United - beaten 2 - 0 away\n\nVs Arsenal - beaten 3 - 1 away\n\nVs Chelsea - drew 2 - 2 away \n\nVs Liverpool - beaten 2 - 1 at home\n\nEvery other team they have played have been pretty shite and that is where all of their points come from. They're the total opposite of LFC who beat strong teams and lose to relegation squads. \n\nThey won't win anything playing this style of football and I honestly don't see them finishing top 3 or even 4 if they carry on like this. Newcastle are already above them and Chelsea, United and Liverpool will start to catch up in the second half of the season. They aren't as safe as some of their supporters may think."

Henderson, Wijnaldum, Milner, often dubbed the \u201cBrexit Midfield\u201d were perfect for this.\n\nCreativity came from two of the most creative players in the league (TAA, Robertson).\n\nEverybody was crying for more creativity in the midfield, and over the last couple of seasons, they\u2019ve got what they asked for. Elliot, Thiago, Carvalho, playmakers who can split the defence with a weighted through ball.\n\nWhat everybody is now discovering though, is that you can only have 11 players on the pitch. By playing these more creative midfielders, you have to sacrifice the hard working defenders. Without them, the whole system fails. The full backs are no longer protected, meaning they don\u2019t have as much freedom to create in the same way they did in the past, and in defence they are left exposed multiple times a game.\n\nLiverpool have moved away from a style, in a very subtle way, that got them to 3 champions league finals, and close to 100 points multiple times. One of the premier league\u2019s best ever sides. They failed to replace Wijnaldum, they failed to anticipate the decline of an aging Henderson and Milner, and have paid the price.\n\nBut I guess at least now they have some midfielders who can get assists, that\u2019s the most important thing, right?"
