2022-10-09 14:33:03,"Honestly? Even though we lost this was a really entertaining game. A lot of back and forth. We fucked it up in the second half but totally dominated the first and got 2 nice comeback goals. The pen was soft but I'm not going to constantly complain about it because the game is over and what's done is done. Arsenal are one of the best teams in the league right now and we're at the Emirates so I never expected a win and hoped for a draw at best. Came down to a controversial penalty winner in the end but I think it's probably a fair result given how well they played in the second half and ET of the first half. Well done to both teams.\n\nAnd well done to Nunez in particular for actually getting a goal btw. That was probably the most surprising moment of the whole game for me.

For sure some dodgy decisions from the ref, but theres a case for either side to get more from him (Gabriel handball/pk and Tsmikas elbows). We played well and were lethal on some counters. Theres a few of those we need to finish off cause an in form Liverpool wont be this wasteful on the ball. Martinelli is just balling off the charts. Back line had a couple shaky moments, but saliba is that guy right now. Absolute baller. Wish we wouldve seen eddie come on for Jesus. I thought he was knocked out cold. Does anyone know what happened when Oliver spoke to the managers? I thought he was gonna  them to chill their players out. Of course the rumor mill on Twitter was running about stuff. Has TAA played himself off the World Cup roster? Maybe ben white convinced southgate today. Tomi pocketed Salah, dude has not been the same since AFCON.",1,-1

I doubt we are going to push city realistically, but just seeing this type of progress in terms of technique, tactics and hopefully, mentality, is testament to the work Arteta and co. have done the last few years.\n\n\nRegardless of where we end up finishing this season...

Since Martinelli signed I always knew this kid was special, he was simply outstanding.\n\nOur defending in the box ironically wasnt the best today, but outside the box no problems. Saliba as usual, such a calm influence. Ben White was fantastic too. \n\nOdegaard stepped up today, great pass for that first goal. He led the press as usual very well. Xhaka & Partey much better 2nd half too. \n\nGabriel Jesus has given his life since he signed for us. Top performance, even though Liverpool were relentless in their pressing on him when he tried to drop deep. \n\nSaka, big boy penalty. So much pressure, cooly taken. Arteta weve had our problems but you got it spot on as most of this season, the subs couldve been a bit earlier but Im only nitpicking. \n\nWatch out for Fabio Vieira btw, that boy is special too.
