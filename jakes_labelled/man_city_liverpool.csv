2023-04-01 19:48:11,"Robertson and TAA really struggling. They used to be wicked dangerous but have really lost their edge. Mad to think TAA has so many assists at such a young age. Huge talent but really poor defender, and poor application. He just left Grealish run off him for the last goal, no appetite, zero pride in the performance. Robertson just looks tired. 

Salah got the goal, it's crazy but that was all he really did. Looked to be somewhat effective in the first half but offered nothing in the second. 

Klopp is at fault for quite a lot of this I think. Man plays 4.3.3 no matter what. Incredible coach, players love him, obviously instils his beliefs in his players, but has zero flexibility as a coach. 

City were phenomenal. The whole team really. Stones looks great in midfield, Grealish and Mahrez ran riot. Alvarez is wasted in City. He will never start over Haaland and is far too good to sit on the bench. Would love to have him at United. Works hard, excellent technically",1,0

Liverpool look shit, but they always have our number at Anfield and PTSD is couldn't be stronger for a fixture, for me.

Having a top top season. \n\nCity really fun to watch today, but Liverpool basically looked like they were doing a hungover training session in the 2nd half.
