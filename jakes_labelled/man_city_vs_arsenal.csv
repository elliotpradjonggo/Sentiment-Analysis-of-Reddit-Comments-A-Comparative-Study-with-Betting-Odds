17:21:59,"I thought De Bruyne was incredible tonight but I honestly think that was Haaland's most complete game for city. \n\nHe worked so hard. Won duels, tracked back, had many great chances, got a couple of assists and one goal. Maybe that is funny to say as he missed some chances but I honestly thought he was unbelievable tonight.",1,0
16:59:43,"Just outclassed sums it up.\n\nCity just relentlessly attacked the weakness thru middle, Holding isnt great but he really wasnt helped by Xhaka and Partey in front of him being awful.\n\n\nHonestly dont know who stops this City side atm guessing Real Madrid CL voodoo is best bet",-1,0
17:00:14,"Haaland and De Bruyne are a scary duo, how they completely dominated Arsenal is ridiculous. Hard to believe this was pretty much a match for the title, Arsenal literally did nothing for 90.",1,-1

17:29:05,"That's one of the most one sided games between two teams challenging for the title with a few games to go I think I've seen. Think back to the City Liverpool games, the Kompany mistake, Coutinho goal, they were very even every time but that game was Arsenal as total passengers.",1,-1
17:17:22,"Yes fuck him and we all hate him, but in all seriousness that performance from partey was absolute horror. The amount of times kdb makes a run past him and he is just looking and jogging back, he had something to do in all of the first 3 goals. Unreal.",1,-1

17:04:47,"City were brilliant. Surprise 4-2-4 buildup, Haaland dropping deep and linking up, Akanji LB... it all came off perfectly. Ever since Pep‚Äôs ‚ÄòI need that, we need that‚Äô speech, they‚Äôve been imperious, peaking today. Wonder if this treble might actually happen... \n\nToday might be the performance that tips KDB into best PL midfielder of all time territory. Utter domination. Arsenal, for all their good work this season, looked nowhere near title contenders today. No fight, outclassed. Partey‚Äôs been really poor for weeks now, give Jorginho some starts.

2023-04-26 17:01:11,"Arsenal were frankly lucky not to concede many more goals, lucky to score, lucky to not get more cards than they did, never mind finishing with 11 players on the pitch.
All things considered with how the game played out a 4-1 loss with only 1 yellow is the best case scenario.,"-1,-1

2023-04-26 17:01:35,"Said this earlier, saying it again. 
I empathize with the good Arsenal fans because coming this far and losing it now for sure will hurt, they manage to stay in title chase this long against this City team. 
But at the same time, for those annoying Arsenal fans who started to talk shit in every thread this season, I'm laughing at your face. Some of you guys talked so much of shit just because you became relevant this season.",-1,-1

2023-04-26 17:05:55,"The title was already lost at West Ham and Southampton and didn't expect even for a second that we could win at the Etihad. Congrats City, our quality and morale just aren't enough yet.
Edit: expect for expect lol",-1,1

2023-04-27 00:08:40,"When I saw Loose Pep winking and joking at the presser I knew. I think my favourite thing was watching Arsenal try to press and KDB was all ‚Äúsure guys whatever‚Äù as he strolled through midfield. 
I really like Jack Grealish. I hope he said what I hope he said to Partey.",1,0

2023-04-26 18:33:45,"I think the reality of things truly settled in today. I have loved arsenal for over 20+ years now,  but City are simply a level above. We had an amazing run with a bright and young squad but the gulf in quality in the run in to the final stretch has shown the difference. With every competition we‚Äôve dropped out of, we fans have told ourselves it‚Äôs ok bc now we can focus more on the league. Well even with cup and Europa pressures off our backs we still squandered it while City are lined up for a treble. This is the true reality of our level. We have an amazing squad to develop and keep pushing, but today we were shown where we stand in the hierarchy. Plenty to shed a tear and be proud of, CL is back on, and we have building blocks for success. We Move!",0,-1

2023-04-27 05:19:03,"As a die-hard Manchester United fan, even I can recognise the massive amount of progress made by Arsenal under Arteta, and a short spell of less than stellar results shouldn't steal his plaudits at season's end. Yes, their premier league title winning chances now look critically jeopardized, but it is still technically attainable if Murphy and his law have anything to do with the rest of the season! Unlikely as it now looks, Arsenal can still win this! But if indeed they do fail to ascend the summit first, as now looks probable, when the disappointment of what so nearly could've been finally settles, there is a lot that the Gunners will be able to look back on with pride, and look forward to with hope",1,1
2023-04-26 17:51:37,"Like, pep does some pretty insane rotation, and has the squad for it, but he‚Äôs ruthless about both attitude and fitness. I don‚Äôt think we have any real behavioral problems, but no one should be undroppable, especially when they‚Äôre clearly fatigued physically or mentally. Trossard should‚Äôve started up front and nelson should have been on the right. Partey should have definitely been off at half time. I understand having faith, and I understand hindsight is 20/20, but the truth is in the results. Sloppy passing, tired legs, nerves. What can I say? For a minute I thought we could win the league as the second best team. Now I‚Äôll have to be happy eventually being behind a clearly dominate city squad. There was a window where pep was trying to reinvent football again and we could‚Äôve snaked it. Oh well. This is a long term project and we‚Äôre showing improvement, even with hiccups.  I just hope they keep learning and we do this again next season with fewer mistakes, and the inevitable ones that hopefully cost less.",-1,0
2023-04-26 18:29:35,"Even shambolic Spurs have won a league game more recently than title chasing Arsenal who have now not won in 4. They aren‚Äôt bottling it though, they‚Äôre plucky.",-1,0
2023-04-26 18:03:26,"I am gonna get downvoted to oblivion for this but I absolutely loathe the ‚ÄúCity have ruined the league‚Äù takes that come after games like these. Assuming Arsenal get back to winning and keep this close this will be 3 out of City‚Äôs last 4 titles that will be decided by less than 3 points. One small thing changes in one match (either by City, Liverpool in past seasons, or Arsenal this season) and City don‚Äôt win the title. They aren‚Äôt unbeatable. You can‚Äôt drop 9 points out of 12 and say that you never had a chance. Also people saying this era of City winning every year will never end grossly underestimate Pep‚Äôs influence on this team. Just look at United during and after SAFs tenure.",1,1
2023-04-26 21:25:53,"Arsenal at the top of the table is like an elephant on a tree. No one knows how it got there, but you do know it'll fall down eventually. Now it's properly in the falling down phase.",-1,0
