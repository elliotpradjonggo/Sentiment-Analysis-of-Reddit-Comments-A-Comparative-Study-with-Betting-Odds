Absolute borefest,neg
This is surely one of the games of all time,pos
This is the kind of game Americans make fun of us for,neg
Impressive that both City and Liverpool have lost their keepers for extended periods this season and had the backup just step in seamlessly. Ortega's looking really solid.,pos
the crucifixion was less painful than this,neg
Doku is every pacey winger I’ve ever signed for my league 2 career mode,neu
Allegri would be so proud of both teams performance today 😩,pos
how odegaard hasnt gotten a yellow is beyond me tbh. just by number alone, feel like hes been everywhere,neu
Hell is just one big movie theatre with this game being played on repeat,neg
such a poor poor game,neg
Now it's our turn to celebrate a draw 🥳,pos
Worst decision to watch this match today,neg
those were 90mins i dont get back.,neg
4 points vs City I'll take that all day,pos
Pep chewing out Grealish,neg
Match thread was class, at least,pos
Pep giving Grealish the business,neg
Woke up, and game put me back to sleep. 💤,neg
Holy shit. From Mustafi and Holding to Gabriel and Saliba. Games like this show how far we’ve come. Zero goals conceded against this city team in a season is not something I would have thought of. Might be a boring game for the neutrals, but it was an incredible game for us.,pos
These City-Arsenal games are porn for the stats nonces , xG enthusiasts and Michael Cox. But if you’re not a beard stroking hipster getting off to the ‘chess match’ this is dull as dishwater.,neu
Reckon a sucker punch would be a yellow today?,neu
I don't get why are yall shocked watching Guardiola and Arteta giving each other no space to exploit. I just think they understand each other way too well for them to not suffocate the fun out of each other's teams. It was always gonna be a tactical match for the football hipsters to enjoy rather than a classic drama filled heavy metal match up for us regular football junkies.,neu
They should bring back 4-4-2 none of this woke Spanish stuff,neg
Why haven't Arsenal just opened up and allowed City to score 3 goals for neutral fans' entertainment? Are they stupid?,neg
How the fuck is that not a card?!!,neg
That's literally a stonewall yellow lol,neg
Really surprised that the two highly neurotic tacticians have played such a tense and closed game, I really thought it would be goals galore and non-stop action from one end of the pitch to the other?,neu
maybe he LITERALLY forgot his cards and doesn't want to look unprofessional?,neu
About £1.2bn worth of players and about another £200m in wages to produce a game you couldn't pay me to watch again.,neg
genuinely feel for the video editor that has to put the highlights recap together,neu
Odegaard still not getting a yellow is WILD.,neu
Clear yellow,neg
Would be a yellow if it wasn’t 2 mins in. Hate that trend,neg
No way he called a foul on Havertz for that….,neu
Not a foul at all wtf,neu
If that’s being called a foul, this is gonna be a bad day..,neu
Team Emirates vs Team Etihad, the Arab Airways Derby 💪🏻💪🏻,neu
I did not just shit my pants right there why do you ask,neu
Feel like pure shite just want Liverpool vs City back x,neu
Such an abject showing from us in the first 25.,neg
Wtf is this game man,neg
Not sustainable. Need to hold the ball for 10 seconds atleast. It's all city right now.,neu
Poor pass by Jesus,neg
Great chance in the making,pos
wish refs just gave the card instead of trying to "manage" the game,neg
Fucking hate those double advertisement boardings,neg
Jesus holy shit, can you complicate it any more,neg
I think he forgot the yellow 🟡 card at home.,neu
Clearly a yellow on Rice. Not only does he grab the arm to hold him back but intentionally trips him either one could be a yellow.....,neg
Still no yellow 🤡,neg
Actually where are the cards now this is laughable,neu
Uh ref???,neu
Thats a clear yellow,neg
Still no yellow what,neg
Arsenal going into a shell. And tbf.. it’s working But it’s shit for fans of the game. City 75% possession with 1 attempt..,neu
Taking a minute for a goal kick just for Raya to do that. Baffling.,neg
This is tough to watch for neutrals,neg
Refs rewarding poor defending by not giving a yellow,neg
Did they get rid of the six second rule?,neu
This is not what we should be served after enduring Brighton earlier,neg
arsenal playing like atletico madrid. It's a good thing.,neu
What a dreadful half,neg
Probably not the worst half Arsenal have played this season, but up there with the least controlling,neg
Honestly, I had more fun looking at the billboards than the match. I was guessing which ad would come next. It was more unpredictable than the game. Great form, ads.,pos
8 cbs 2 dms and fullbacks being the motm for both sides, games very much gone,neu
Predictably boring and insipid, so presumably the tacticos love it.,neu
Neurosis in football form. Purely in terms of watching title-contending fixtures, every neutral will miss Klopp.,neu
Legit fell asleep multiple times during this half,neg
The 2 teams are too similar in style that they cancel each other out which is turning this game into a very dry game,neg
Roy Keane's face, dead,neg
Same again please,neu
This half is like the final season of Game of Thrones,neg
Lots of hype to build up to a disappointment,neg
Sorry, NBC, but associating the Premier League with country music is just gonna make me less interested in the Premier League,neg
Snooze fest,neg
Still funny every time I see [this guy](https://i.imgur.com/qMDK5Es.png) on the bench for Man fuckin' City,neg
Saka showing absolutely nothing today. Just safe passes, not taking a man on.,neg
Antony Taylor just cant handle these tyoes of matches he always loses the plot,neg
Lol does someone need to get punched before the cards come out??,neg
Anthony Taylor masterclass,neg
0 bookings ...,neu
Can’t even call this an interesting tactical battle it’s honestly just

 a dead game so far. 10 players who can play CB on the pitch and it shows,neu
He's never been particularly pacey but it feels like KDB has lost a lot of pace since the injury,neg
Taylor wants to see a decapitated head before he produces a card...,neg
Man they've locked out KDB out of doing anything,neg
Who's the fucking Crimson Chin behind Pep?,neu
City should have to start every game with -1 goals just for making me look at that shitty OKX logo. I already see enough of those crypto scammers on McLaren’s car,neg
Someone could get straight up stabbed on the field and Anthony Taylor won't even give a yellow,neg
FA needs to investigate whether someone has bet all their lives savings on there not being a single card in this game.,neg
Good lord this is a snooze fest 😴,neg
just give klopp his farewell title and call it a day,neu
HOLY SHIT A YELLOW!!,neu
Arsenal timewasting at 0-0 in the 66th minute is embarrassing ngl,neg
Grealish would have the golden "Backpass" trait in Fifa if it existed,neg
That might be the worst 15 seconds of football I've ever seen,neg
I just screamed at the TV,neg
This is legitimately bad football,neg
can't believe i saw that in a professional match between teams of the highest standards,neg
how is that not a yellow hahahahajaha. worst one all game,neg
I love how they started putting Japanese beer ad on the board as soon as tomiyasu got on lmao,neu
can the sky commentary say anything else other than the players names lmao so boring and dead tone,neg
Oh no scary eyes man coming,neu
What has he seen,neu
Anthony Taylor should be investigated for this performance.,neg
The lack of cards in this game is baffling,neg
Every city player immediately running between Taylor and Silva so he gets confused and forgets to pull out a card,neg
So is that not another yellow in this match that goes by?,neu
I refuse to believe the best ref the FA can find for these big games is Anthony fucking Taylor lol,neg
Please for the love of God don't let this fixture be a champions league semi final.,neg
El Assico,neg
Liverpool winning the league because City and Arsenal are afraid of attacking well,neg
As a Liverpool fan this has turned from a casual hatewatch to a nail biting anxiety watch,neg
As dire as this has been to watch, a shitty 0-0 is the best result for us.,neg
I was told that Arsenal were gonna bring it to City. That wad greatly exaggerated,neg
Partey is cooked, we should’ve offloaded him in the summer,neg
Time wasting when you have the chance to go top of the table is mad ngl,neg
Can't believe how much I looked forward to this game, then it being a zzzzzzz!,neg
A time wasting yellow less than 5 seconds after the ref blows the whistle to resume play is actually hilarious,neg
If i had to bear this shit for 90 minutes only for city to score in the 90th minute i might not watch a PL game ever again,neg
So we’ve had a yellow for kicking the ball away and one for time wasting after all the fouls,neg
Wtf is wrong with this ref,neg
Odegaard's through passing has been horrible,neg
Doku is the Nicholas Jackson of city,neg
Odegaard's best skills might be defensive lol,neg
Doku to LAFC confirmed,neg
Worst thing is this could potentially be a champions league semi final fixture,neg
Doku 💀,neg
Grealish used to be a lot of fun to watch, very similar to peak Hazard. Now all he does is cross or cutbacks.,neg
Did he do a… stepover???,neu
God man this is so frustating,neg
The Indonesian 5th division matches I bet on at 4 AM are more exciting than this,neg
No refunds,neg
Give Alvarez the last 10 minutes, he can't possibly be less impactful than Haaland has been.,pos
There needs to be a VAR controversy otherwise I will forget this game was ever played,neg
Both these fraud terrorist tiki tala coaches just stood there in their Zara gear like it’s ok,neg
Trossards fucked that massively, could’ve played in martinelli,neg
Trossard just pulled a sterling brother PASS THST TO MARTINELLI,neg
Trossard thinks he's that guy,neg
should have gone to the gym instead of watching this,neg
Bernardo Silva is somehow stronger than Haaland,neg
Terrorist ball by Arteta, counter attack fc,neg
Can I have these 2 hours of my life back?,neg
Even Taylor is time wasting,neg
Antony got so far into Doku’s head that he’s started playing like him,neg
Should've set up Havertz there Leo,neg
Trossard really should have passed to Martinelli there,neg
Solution: Save the money spent on potential strikers, pour it into time travel and cloning research to replicate a 25-year-old Henry,neg
What an utterly boring game to watch,neg
Commentator really said "blockbuster" game,neg
Let's all act surprised when city gets a 90+7 winner,neg
5 minutes? There’s hardly been any stoppage,neg
Why doesn’t Alvarez get minutes in this match ?,neu
Haaland with the "who the fook is that guy" reaction lol,neg
Can't wait for the halland clip posted,neg
Penalty gonna be given in the 94 minute to top this match off would be fitting.,neg
Best league in the world,neg
Pls end don’t let me watch doku on the ball any longer,neg


Gvardiol MOTM for me,pos
Gvardiol MOTM,pos
“The confidence this does for Arsenal”
Graeme what are you on about,neu
i think that i could defend 1v1 vs doku, not that i wouldnt be dribbled past, more like he cant shoot or cross,neg
Gvardiol and Gabriel are probably MOTMs. Such a weak attacking game,neu
last time I ever watch Pep against Arteta,neg
Wanted Jesus to do well on Easter Sunday tbh,pos
After the banger yesterday, we're being treated to this dross lol. And don't forget it's supposed to be the biggest game of this season 😂,neg
I get to eat some Banh Mi now thank god,neu
Hate the crying about situations like that, you’ve got to go for the ball and everyone would want their player going for it,neu
What game did people expect, the game at The Emirates early in the season was exactly the same. They just cancel each other out.,neu
City remind me of the AI team from that old Nike advert. Exceptionally good but so fucking robotic and boring to watch,neg
Ben White has the same skin tone as Ake wtf,neg
How many fouls until a yellow🤣🤣,neu
0 yellow cards, what a masterclass from Anthony Taylor..,neg
Liverpool city is always exciting, arsenal city is always boring or a beat down past few years,neg
Football like this is like modern high jazz. You suspect the only people who enjoy it are sadists or people who are in too deep. Obsessive, circle-jerking Complexity ™️ at the expense of melody.,neg
Taylor should've given out about 10 yellows by now, what the actual fuck,neg
1 import praw,neg
Haaland doesn't get enough criticism for how shit he is in important games, even Kane is better,neg
Give both these teams zero points,neg
Did the commentators say you can feel the tension?
Hacks,neu
Don’t let the xG and field tilt nerds gaslight you, that was an awful 90 minutes of “football”.,neg
Is this a preview of the post Klopp years?,neu
Today was the first time KDB looked "aged" to me. Seemed physically and emotionally exhausted. Still a scary presence.,neg
Roy having absolutely no time for Game Of Thrones gives me life,neu
People saying these teams are making football boring or ruining the game, but these teams have scored shitload of goals in their other fixtures in this league.
I don't think many teams can cancel these two attacks like they do each other. Just look at the defenders+defensive midfielder units, they can be nasty how they give no chance to the forwards, let alone goals. Or how both sets of forwards press tf out of the playmakers for the whole game... I'm sure they'll go back to banging goals after facing each other.,pos
When I hear those annoying Americans complain on about how boring football is, this was what they’re talking about.,neu
People need to stop hyping City - Arsenal matches. They are never fun.,neg
I’ve had more entertainment watching 2 pigeon’s fight over a sausage roll then this game,neg
Anthony Taylor deserves so much more hate.

I just dont get why the PL continues to give him big games. Dude is beyond clueless.,neg
Here comes the rapist,neg
Haha that’s a dirty challenge, and a yellow card any day other than today. And that’s what happens when refs don’t book for clear tactical fouls early on,neg
So you can just kick the ball out of the keepers hands and it’s just a foul no card. Should do that every time,neg
I got up at 1:30am to watch this. It’s now 3:30am and I have gained nothing,neg
Game was back.

Then they shook hands and hugged.

Game's gone 😢,neg
gabi xl and haaland sex tape when?,neg
City are so blunt in attack this season,neg
Like I said, if KDB dont work, this team don't work. You can rely on Bernardo and the gang to carry out the tactics and contribute here and there, but KdB makes this team chug. If he's off, so is Haaland, and so is City's teeth.,neu
Can we come together as a sub and pray that Jesus doesn’t score. As people have been putting on twitter Drury would go mad,neg
My stream just stuck harry potter on for some reason instead wtf,neg
Taylor already bottling it,neg
That's a booking, doesn't matter what time of the game. He's feet away from the box,neg
Silva RW > Silva CM

I'll die on that hill,neu
Lollll no yellow wtf,neg
Very lucky to get away without a card, probably because it's so early but it was absolutely deserved,neg
Jesus transformed into a Brazilian DM there with how he escaped a card,neg
oh god it's Antony Taylor, this guy can't retire soon enough,neg
Garry Neville is so boring on commentary, surely Sky with all their money can find someone better to do the job.,neg
What was the foul there,neu
famous wingers Akanji and Gvardiol holding width.,neu
