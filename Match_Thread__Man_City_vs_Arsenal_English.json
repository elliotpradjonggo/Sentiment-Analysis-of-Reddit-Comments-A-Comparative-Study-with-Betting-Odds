Wonder if this treble might actually happen... \n\nToday might be the performance that tips KDB into best PL midfielder of all time territory. Utter domination. Arsenal, for all their good work this season, looked nowhere near title contenders today. No fight, outclassed. Partey\u2019s been really poor for weeks now, give Jorginho some starts.

We simply don't have the squad depth nor world class players to go toe to toe for 90 minutes.\n\nI love him but his arrogance was on show yesterday. Tottenham and Manchester United have laid out the blueprint for overcoming City, and its largely down to sitting deep and hitting them on the counter. We refuse to do this at all for some reason.\n\nFor the life of me I have no idea why arteta thought we could outfight them, especially with saliba out injured. So many times City got behind our backline because we refused to sit in and it was only ramsdale heroics that kept the score from being truly embarrassing."

We had an amazing run with a bright and young squad but the gulf in quality in the run in to the final stretch has shown the difference. With every competition we\u2019ve dropped out of, we fans have told ourselves it\u2019s ok bc now we can focus more on the league. Well even with cup and Europa pressures off our backs we still squandered it while City are lined up for a treble. This is the true reality of our level. We have an amazing squad to develop and keep pushing, but today we were shown where we stand in the hierarchy. Plenty to shed a tear and be proud of, CL is back on, and we have building blocks for success. We Move!"

Yes, their premier league title winning chances now look critically jeopardized, but it is still technically attainable if Murphy and his law have anything to do with the rest of the season! Unlikely as it now looks, Arsenal can still win this! But if indeed they do fail to ascend the summit first, as now looks probable, when the disappointment of \"what so nearly could've been\" finally settles, there is a lot that the Gunners will be able to look back on with pride, and look forward to with hope, assuming the next moves made are good.\n\nFocusing on the future, the decisions Arsenal make in the summer recess will be critical to their fortunes going forward. It is easy to rest on laurels and fall off a cliff at this point, as Brendan Rogers, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and Claudio Ranieri all know very well. The one thing the Gunners must not do, is allow themselves to fall into the trap of thinking they came really close this year, so only minor tweaks are required to overtake City next year. That would be a huge mistake to make! Arsenal have serious issues where quality in depth is concerned. To put it mildly, Arsenal have no depth of any great consequence, and it takes way too few absences from Arteta's favourite XI, to render his otherwise world class first team, bang average. They did well enough without Jesus for a spell, but Saliba's absence has been telling. Can anyone imagine how much worse Arsenal would be without any one of Odergaard, Partey,, Martinelli, Saka, Ramsdale, or White as well?!  The work required in the summer is clear - sell the poor and average, replace with proven title-winning mettle, and highly promising quality talent. This is where the club's sporting ambition must show, and anything less than serious investment on a rebuild/overhaul scale will be a boon for the likes of my beloved Red Devils, and Citeh. If Araenal are not bidding for the likes of Jude Bellingham, Pedri, Gavi, Musiala and Osimhen, they are missing the point by a galactic mile. Oh, and Arsenal had better reinforce Arteta's contract, even if it was only extended last year. When Real Madrid come calling... and they will, he will need way more reasons to stay than he already has, especially if Arsenal don't improve his squad in the summer!"

Arsenal played extremely poor while City absolutely battered them. \n\nInteresting that for this game City played their more traditional setup with a back 4, 2 pivots, and de bruyne as a CAM. Rather, in other games they would play a back three with stones as an inverted fullback going into the middle to form a box midfield.\n\nThis game for City was all about possession. For as good as Pep's Barca were (the best in history imo) this type of possession based game is the most defensive style you can employ. Holding onto the ball and calmly moving it about, you take less risks. You need good players to pull this off tho. However in this situation, Arsenal's positioning and press were completely ineffective. It was ridiculous imo. Organized Pressing is how you beat City's possession style. Ur fighting for the title, you need to get off ur ass and press both intelligently and with urgency. There was none of that when City were knocking about the ball. I'm sure City was gonna play this way initially, but the first goal solidified that style of play and dictated the rest of the game. \n\nHaalands and KDBs link up play this game was fantastic. For each of City's goals they took Arsenals weak press out of the game and played inbetween the lines to find either of these two players. Haaland's hold up play in particular was really good this game. He won all of his battles against Holding. Taking him out of his position and creating huge holes for KDB to run into. I've been really scathing of Arsenal in this post, but its unfortunately warranted. The players were genuinely poor. \n\nPrem teams usually play this suicidal high defensive line. It's great since you can press higher and win the ball higher up. However you CAN'T LEAVE HOLES. Haaland's hold up play + looming runners proved why it's suicidal. Partey as the single pivot had too much to cover, and while Zinchenko can act as a second pivot the threat of silva/walker is always looming (not so much this game tho), he switched back to a traditional fullback in the second half.\n\n**Amateur opinon:** \n\nIf I was Arteta, I would have probably put Jorghino on as soon as the second half started to help out Partey. You needed two acting CDMs to cover the midfield while watching KDB/Haalands looming presence. As well as to progress the ball (as Arsenal didn't throughout the game). \n\nIt was a good year for Arsenal tho. They've massively improved over the years and have a good coach in Arteta. If I had to give Arsenal a pass, this City team is the best Pep has ever had. They however need to improve their mentality if they want to compete in the future. Easier said than done, but it's gotta be done if you want to beat this monstrous City team."

He saw that against Liverpool.  He saw it happen against West Ham and he saw it happen against Southampton.\n\nThe last 4-5 years, when Pep has gone to Anfield, their biggest rivals in the 2-horse races we've had between them, City played completely differently, and respected the ***massive*** threat posed to them by Liverpool.\n\nArteta coming to City's ground, thinking the team can play the same was as they do with Saliba even ***if*** he was in the team, would've been somewhat naive.  To do it with Rob Holding? Nah.  That's just insane.\n\nIf we'd have drawn tonight, yes, it would mathematically be in City's hands but we'd only be hoping for one draw in their last 7 for that to change.  Now?  No chance."
