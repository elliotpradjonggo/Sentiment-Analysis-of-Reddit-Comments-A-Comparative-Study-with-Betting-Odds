All competitions it\u2019s 1 clean sheet from 8 for Chelsea/Leicester. \u00a3200k a week\n\n\u00a357m on Marc Cucurella, one of the worst fullbacks I have seen in the division this season, a man who can barely make it 10 yards without tripping over his feet. A man who\u2019s won 8 games from the 26 he\u2019s played this season, losing 9 and keeping just 6 clean sheets. \u00a3175k a week, for a backup\n\n\u00a349m on Raheem Sterling, and while he\u2019s been decent, he\u2019s yet to hit 10 G/A in all competitions and we are almost in March. 4 from 17 in the league, but only 1 goal in his last 13 league games and even he hasn\u2019t been involved in a win in 2023, albeit from only 5 attempts. The wages are the issue here, he\u2019ll be taking \u00a316m a year until 2027\n\n\u00a333m on Kalidou Koulibaly, who Napoli have cashed in on at the perfect time. He has 1 clean sheet from his last last 6 league appearances, and has already lost 11 games in a Chelsea shirt. That\u2019s another \u00a3200k a week until he\u2019s 34\n\n\u00a310m for Aubameyang isn\u2019t bad, until you realize they\u2019re paying him \u00a3160k a week, for 3 goals in 19 appearances, and 1 goal contribution in his 13 in all comps. He\u2019s on the payroll until he\u2019s 35\n\n\u00a39m for Jo\u00e3o Felix on loan, with no option to buy, and paying \u00a3250k per week. He\u2019s made only 4 appearances for the club, scoring 1, and Chelsea have only scored twice and taken 1 point from the games he played. Not necessarily his fault, but not the game changer expected\n\n\u00a3105m on Enzo Fernandez, who is yet to win a match since signing an 8-year at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea scored only 1 goal in the process. \n\n\u00a361m+ for Mykhalo Mudryk, a man with 0 goals and 0 assists in 5 appearances for Chelsea, and like Enzo, yet to win a match in blue. The team have 1 goal in that timeframe, and barely featured in a dour 0-0 on his home debut. Nearly \u00a3100k for less than a season of experience\n\n\u00a330m for Noni Madueke, a more reasonable fee, however he has no goal contributions in his 3 appearances, and is yet another player yet to see his side win a match. Another 7 year deal as well\n\n\u00a310m on David Datro Fofana, only 3 appearances but sadly for the lad he\u2019s yet to even celebrate a goal on the pitch for anyone yet, his side outscored 0-2 in his time on the pitch\n\n\u00a322m for Potter and his staff from Brighton, for 5 league wins and 21 points from 18 games, and 2 wins from his last 15 league games. It gets even worse from an attacking perspective, only 16 scored in 18 games, and 3 scored in his last 10. Not to mention losing 4-1 to the team that he abandoned 6 games in\n\nBenoit Badiashile is the only real success here, \u00a333m and another fun 7 year contract. At least he got a win on his debut\n\n\nThis is honestly unprecedented levels of staggering failure, \u00a3490m spent on a champions league side, only to be languishing in 10th level on points with Aston Villa"

Another shite performance where we genuinely didn't look like scoring for 90 mins again. 3 goals scored in the last 8, 1 in the last 6. 2 wins in the last 17/18? Horrendous for any team in any league in the world.  Never been satisfied with our trigger happiness when it comes to managers in recent times, but this is the one time where it's absolutely necessary, there is no process, there is just nothing.

Rio was saying the biggest thing is can deal with being at a club like United, Ajax are huge but in terms of pressure United is different. Seems silly now but it was a genuine concern.\n\nI\u2019ve seen it time and time again at United, players that should have been good enough crumbling in that environment, managers too. It\u2019s the part of managing below that level can never teach you, it\u2019s in you or it\u2019s not.\n\nPotter is a small club man, and I don\u2019t mean that in a disrespectful way, but he\u2019s an underdog manager, he plays pretty decent football, he\u2019s good at getting talent out of cheap players and doing well.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of that just doesn\u2019t translate to the level of Chelsea, there\u2019s no trying at a club like that, there\u2019s no effort. It\u2019s binary. You win or you fail. Fans say they just want someone to play for the shirt but not at a club like that, yes you want that but if you\u2019re losing who cares.\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest issue for potter and this Chelsea team. It\u2019s not tactics or players or whatever (obviously all these ARE also factors) it\u2019s FEAR.\n\nTo me it looks like Potter goes out to try not to lose rather than to win, he\u2019s so scared of getting it wrong that he\u2019s paralysed. He can\u2019t make effective changes, he just wants to not lose and when you\u2019re at an underdog club, you can afford to be a bit like that lose 3, win 5 easy but at Chelsea? Not a chance.\n\nHe\u2019s a rabbit in the headlights at the moment."

The club had pretty much no pressure on them as they were never expected to flourish, and any time they did they were praised for it. Potter now has the complete opposite with an owner who genuinely has no idea about football and only knows how to make money. It's a horrible time to be the Chelsea manager and I do really believe that Potter is an absolutely fantastic manager with great ideas, but how on earth do you expect him to do anything with all the injuries he's had as well as the club forcing about 6 insanely high profile players into his club. \n\nThey should just be focused on next season now and should not spend any more in the summer unless it's a fantastic striker. They have the players, they just need to form them into some sort of team."

Maybe Todd and co are seeing something I am not but as someone who watches all the games (as a season ticket holder), we have regressed so much.  \nThere are levels to this game and sadly, Potter isn\u2019t that good. At this point, we are chasing 42pts"
