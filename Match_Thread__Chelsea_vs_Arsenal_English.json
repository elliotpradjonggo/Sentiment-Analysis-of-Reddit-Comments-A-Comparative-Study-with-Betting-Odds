I don\u2019t know where he left his shooting boots, but he\u2019s doing everything else fantastically so he\u2019s still such an asset on the pitch."

Potter is still new and obviously it will take him time. For example we played a back 4 today, and we played a back 4 last game, 3atb before that.

You look at Arsenal and you can see who is a true and true Arsenal player. The cliche of club DNA ETC\u2026Chelsea seem lost in a void especially now James and Chilwell are injured. They lack all sorts of personality and drive. You then have players like. Silva and Azpilicueta seem to be the only ones who care about the shirt but they are in the twilight of their careers. Mount seems constantly lost. Sterling is a complete waste. Loftus Cheek looks paces behind everyone else. The whole team just seems fucking lost and Chelsea itself seems completely void of any identity and personality. Potter is new to his job but this is going to take such a overhaul. What does it mean to be a Chelsea player. What is the club truly about. Chelsea seems to go through this every few years but this seems to be more troubling that usual.Its going to be a very long long long season for them at this rate."

Guy is on his way to be world class. Happy to see Zinny get back in the game. Martinelli was a bit wank, but he\u2019s young and Azpi was good today. Great team win, team looks bought in on Arteta.

Why does Aubameyang start every game, he gives nothing off the ball, i thought Potter picked on form and not big names. Why not play 3 midfielders when it was obvious that was needed, complete disconnect between attack and defense. At what point does one give up on RLC, man has the skill but is hiding every game, never a risky pass or shot. Another jorginho? Pointless. Only kovacic looks good enough for chelsea at the moment. Real questions for potter now all that talk of dynamism but we get sitting back against arsenal at home and losing."
