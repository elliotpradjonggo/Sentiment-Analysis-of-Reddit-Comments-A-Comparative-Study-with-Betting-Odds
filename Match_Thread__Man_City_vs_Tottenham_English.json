He's easily one of the best wide players in Europe but imo he needs to be more consistent.

Kulusevski and Kane were really the only attackers that looked like they could something for Spurs, Son hasn't been himself this season and I worry he's now in a decline."

            "comment": "There's a lot of bullshit said by random commentators on the live commentary of games in The Guardian, but I found this comment interesting, if exaggerated. \n\n\u201cThe virtue of patience in football is overrated. Confirmation bias kicks in because the better teams usually enjoy more possession and, when they eventually do convert it into goals (as they should), their patience is lauded. But nobody counts the goals impatience would have brought. City have looked more impatient in this half than at any time in weeks and far better for it in terms of outcomes and entertainment.\u201d\n\nCity in fact often give up making uncertain passes, risky and vertical plays that could result in a great chance to score, in the name of controlling the game, and avoiding giving the ball away to a counterattack. In a way, this reflects the evolution of football: quality above quantity, as embodied by the now popular xG stat. Watch a game from the 60s, 80s, 90s or 2000s, and you will see how football was much less refined because teams did far more truly ludicrous shots from outside the box and with very little chance of scoring, and far more vertical, long and direct passes with little chance of a player in your team managing to reach the ball or winnning the duel with the opponent. This evolution in football is good, but finding the balance between these approaches is very complicated in such a chaotic and unpredictable sport. I would say finding that balance is Guardiola's never-ending mission in his study of football. Same thing goes for Klopp. Any manager.\n\nLook at the play at 1:02 to 1:19 of the video below, from Milan vs. Napoli in the 1990/1991 Serie A season. I think it embodies what I say about old football. It is a great play that results in a great goal chance, but the ball went astray far more often than not though, making the game be less polished. You also notice this a lot if you watch 2000s Premier League games for example, and the average viewer did not care about stats like possession and percentage of accurate passes.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TnQ3i21_4lk"

Kane enabling Sonny with their partnership. A fullback who passes Sonny the ball instead of consistently crossing it into the box.\r  \n\r  \nEverything changed this season: Kane moved further into the box and the midfield has no creativity. Perisic was brought in to spam crosses into the box. No one's position on the team changed as much as Sonny's did during the offseason. You don't go from EPL golden boot winner to getting the least touches on the team.\r  \n\r  \nA good manager assesses the strengths of the team and makes the team work around him. Sonny's season hasn't been good but Spurs fans are deluding themselves if they think Sonny is the reason the season is panning out the way that it is. If anything, it's proved how much Spurs relied on Sonny previously and the manager needs to adjust to make it work."

Disappointing but they can still get a result at home. \n\nI do think looking at the fixtures City are still Favourites, arsenal and city\u2019s toughest remaining games are both each other but where you look at where city have lost games in the league it\u2019s United away where arsenal lost, Liverpool away which arsenal could easily lose depending on form going into it and injuries, Arsenal never beat Liverpool away under Klopp, and Brentford at home which I don\u2019t expect arsenal to lose. \n\nFor city they have spurs away, Brentford away which is the final day so might not matter Newcastle at home and Brighton away as their only games I think they can drop points outside each other. Arsenal could also easily lose or draw to villa like city did Emery will be up for it, however I\u2019d expect arsenal to beat Everton at home. \n\nI know City haven\u2019t been at their best but looking at the games left I think they\u2019ll win it there\u2019s so long to go and arsenal have too many tough games. Just really need to hope we beat them and united home and spurs beat them to give us a good gap."
