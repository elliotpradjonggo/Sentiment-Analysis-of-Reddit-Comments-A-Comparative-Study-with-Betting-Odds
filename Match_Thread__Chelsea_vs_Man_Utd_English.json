Graham Potter makes a tactical change, with Kovacic replacing Cucurella, and Chelsea moving to a back 4\n\n**HALF TIME** Chelsea 0-0 Man United\n\n**51** - SUBSTITUTION. First Man United change, as Sancho is replaced by Fred\n\n**59** - SUBSTITUTION. Nasty looking injury for Varane, who comes off for Lindelof. The Frenchman looked quite distressed\u2026 with his World Cup potentially in jeopardy\n\n**72** - SUBSTITUTION. Aubameyang is replaced by Pulisic.\n\n**78** - SUBSTITUTION. Two more Chelsea changes, Broja and Chukwuemeka on for Sterling and Loftus Cheek\n\n**79** - SUBSTITUTION. Man United changes. McTominay and Elanga on for Eriksen and Rashford\n\n**85** - a poor McTominay challenge on Broja, and Chelsea have a penalty! VAR will check, but looks a pen\u2026\n\n**87** - some Casemiro penalty spot shithousing sees him booked\u2026\n\n**87** - GOAL! Jorginho beats De Gea. **Chelsea 1-0 Man United**\n\n**89** - a booking for Luke Shaw, for a challenge on Azpilicueta\n\n**90+4** - GOAL! Man United equalise at the death. It\u2019s Casemiro, and it\u2019s **Chelsea 1-1 Man United**\n\n#FINAL SCORE: Chelsea 1-1 Man United"

Nothing wrong with the defending and the work rate of pretty much all 22 players, but first touches, passing, cross, shooting all sub-par.\n\nSimple balls along the ground are hit too slow, not a single cross has cleared the first man, can't recall a keeper ever being tested.\n\nEven corners and free kicks are just going hopelessly too far or out of play, it's quite strange."
