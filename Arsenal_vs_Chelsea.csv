2023-05-02 17:24:36,Lampard's managerial career will not undo his legacy as a player, but I wonder if there is a limit to the depth of that goodwill,-1,0

2023-05-02 16:55:04,Azpilicueta was comically angry today. Arteta and his coaching staff were very negligent in waiting for Gabriel to drop down for the 4th time before they finally subbed him off.,-1,-1
2023-05-02 16:54:58,Considering where Chelsea were when Boehly etc. took over and where they are now, has there ever been a faster decline of a club under new ownership?,-1,-1

2023-05-02 17:41:55,Chelsea wasted their monthly goal when they where already 3-0 smh.,-1,0
2023-05-02 16:57:33,Look I know it's nothing to whinge about, we won and largely played well, and Kiwior looked pretty decent.  But why don't we kill teams off? I've seen so many games like this this year, especially at home: take good lead, playing great. Pursue a 4th, don't get it, switch off get complacent and concede a sloppy goal.  We could have pumped them for 5 or 6 today and it doesn't really matter that we didn't, but it's happened in so so many games, and in some recent games it actually cost us points.,0,-1
2023-05-02 16:56:12,Why does 3-1 feel like a loss for Arsenal,-1,0
2023-05-02 17:10:48,Just the 17 losses in his last 20 games for Frank,-1,0
2023-05-02 16:55:12,Man Lampard saying that Mudryk needs to learn defensive responsibilities of a winger and then starts Sterling in his place is funniest thing ever. Clearly has learnt nothing,-1,0

2023-05-02 16:57:01,Embarrassed that we didn’t keep a clean sheet against this Chelsea team, good response otherwise,-1,1
2023-05-02 17:10:35,Arsenal looked like they were going to smash Chelsea for 5 or 6 in the first half then took their foot off the gas so hard it was as if they were picking their noses with their toes. Chelsea looked a lot better 2nd half but only because we allowed them to.,0,-1

2023-05-02 17:24:04,We won but somehow... I feel let down a bit. This team really doesn't know how to kill off games. Excellent performance for the first 60 but I'm not too confident of going to St James Park next week.,0,-1
2023-05-02 17:25:52,We’re one away from 007, I believe.,1,0
2023-05-03 04:40:58,Laugh all you want! This is all part of the plan. Just like every great American owner, Todd Boehly has had one and only one goal ever since he bought Chelsea Football Club: winning the Championship.,0,-1
2023-05-02 19:05:15,You know, it would be quite historic if Chelsea got relegated. Can you say the most expensive flop of a team in the history of football?,-1,0

2023-05-03 01:56:24,Really shocking that Chelsea manage to score a whole month worth of goal in just a half against the top team of the league,-1,1
2023-05-02 16:57:12,I wish we weren’t so nice, we should’ve embarrassed them here. They looked hopeless,-1,0
2023-05-02 17:39:19,If we weren’t so awful ourselves, I’d enjoy Fofana being a part of the Chelsea mess more,-1,0
2023-05-02 16:55:11,I know Chelsea getting relegated is near impossible but it would be entertaining to see what happens when one if not the most expensive team in the world plays Championship football and what are the consequences of that,-1,0
2023-05-02 17:44:30,Chelsea have really dropped in form, Jesus. I don't watch them that much but when you have to watch them for 90 minutes...It's like watching a documentary over the life and times of Amy Winehouse but at 0.25 speed. It's a little disturbing how a club of Chelsea's stature can drop off like that. I don't think this'll be a quick fix either.,-1,0
2023-05-02 18:37:23,The fact Chelsea aren’t mathematically safe just fills me with so much joy.,0,-1
2023-05-02 17:02:50,Can’t believe I’m disappointing to only win 3-1. We once again completely switched off in the second half,0,-1
2023-05-02 17:03:03,lasers on mudryk were fucking disgraceful btw. lifetime bans should be upheld,-1,0
"2023-05-02 17:08:56,One of our best league victories in recent years was a 2-1 win against this team. Half an hour in, Lampard gave Tariq Lamptey his Chelsea debut and took the experienced player Emerson off. Lamptey bossed it and helped lead the comeback. Tammy Abraham, Fikyao Tomori, Mason Mount, Reece James, Callum Hudson-Odoi all played in that match. Now Chukwuemeka can't make the match day squad, Lewis Hall played a meaningless friendly against Monaco U21s today. 6 consecutive defeats. 2 goals scored. Those who ""deserve to play"" are failing while those who have to ""earn their spot"" are being neglected for literally zero reason other than trying to save face. Lampard had a prime opportunity to at least galvanize the fan base with what made his first tenure so fun and he's botched it so spectacularly and fielded a team made up of majority players who have been searching for the exit door the minute the last game is over. He can draw a line with Joao Felix but Sterling, Kovacic can still roam around the pitch not giving any effort or fucking up for the 100th time in 10 minutes and he sees nothing wrong with that. Play the washed up corpse of Cesar Azpilicueta but not Chalobah. None of this makes sense. It's all infuriating. This summer is so, so important like you wouldn't believe.,-1,0"
2023-05-02 17:20:20,Do Arsenal still have a chance to win the Prem this season?,1,0
2023-05-02 16:54:53,Chelsea got Man City, Man UTD, Newcastle and two relegation battle teams of Forrest and Bournemouth. It's not looking good lmao.,0,-1
2023-05-02 20:53:26,Is it really shocking for a team amidst a title race to beat up on a team facing potential relegation?,0,-1
2023-05-02 16:56:40,Chelsea could still “technically” get relegated, right? Very unlikely but mathematically speaking,-1,0
2023-05-02 18:32:08,I would say us and Chelsea are equally shite in being out of European competition and on our 3rd manager of the season, but at least we didn’t spend the GDP of a small country doing it.,0,-1
2023-05-03 02:20:47,006 ????. can’t believe what is actually happening lmao. how bad do you have to be to lose 6 straight in a row ??????. with a squad that spent 600 mill this season…. this chelsea season is historic. come on bournemouth it’s in your hands now please don’t fuck up the 007 ?????. i swear i’ll be so mad if we drop points against this chelsea team when we face them. surely not united, don’t even think about it.,1,-1
2023-05-03 02:52:12,Do you think Todd reckons that by losing all these games, Chelsea will get a better draft pick or something?,-1,0

2023-05-02 18:31:55,With this win Arsenal have twice as many points as Chelsea this season lmao,1,-1
2023-05-02 18:42:37,The owner must send Tuchel a special gift at the end of the season for their early season form where they actually picked up some points. If not for that they'd be in the relegation spots right now.,1,-1
"2023-05-02 17:08:59,A rather anti-climactic second half after a furiously positive first. Happy we won but it’s hard to be optimistic knowing that the inevitable City juggernaut lurks in the rear view mirror. Also wish our players just don’t step off the pedal when we’re on top. Chelsea were absolutely there for a battering; 5 or 6 goals would’ve helped put the misery of the past few weeks behind. Losing a clean sheet didn’t help either. Now we can only wait for City to somehow drop points. I really wish Gabriel recovers before the weekend. And i really want Saka to be rested for a game; but again i don’t expect that to happen this weekend given the stature of the game. Also, i knew a Chelsea were having bad season but in the first half they struggled to string 4 passes together coherently. Watching that was absolutely painful yet comical.,1,-1"
2023-05-02 17:03:19,Players were shit but this has to be it for Frank at the top level. He is genuinely one of the worst managers since Potter.,-1,0
2023-05-03 00:47:47,I remember the Ole vs Lampard debate and in hindsight, it’s so funny. Ole wasn’t a top coach by any means but he’s million miles ahead of Lampard. I can only imagine if Ole had such a record.,0,-1

2023-05-02 17:08:03,Genuinely thought Chelsea were gonna put the final nail in the coffin but I guess I underestimated how fucking terrible they were,-1,0

2023-05-02 17:03:45,Good to get back to winning ways. We took our foot off the gas too much in the second half. Loved Kiwior today. Had a wobble with Havertz there at the end, aside from that. Strong Zinny needs to be benched. He’s been beaten/ turned the ball over far too many times lately. KT needs a run out.  Chelsea players need to refund their fans. That was a spineless performance. Only person I could say that earned any respect was Noni. Bunch of dudes just walking around showing no effort or a care in the world. Lamps plz stay at Chelsea,1,-1 performance, looks good in the air, good reading of the game and smart 1v1 defending. Love that Odegaard banged 2 of them. Happy for GJ as well. Need Saka to get back to his usual standard on Sunday. I thought Jorginho was quality and Xhaka had a couple good moments.
2023-05-02 17:06:16,I have been plenty critical of Frank over the years, but it feels like most of these players are not giving him anything.,0,-1
2023-05-02 17:14:01,Honestly at this point can we start our youngsters like Chukwuemba Hall Webster etc give them some minutes. can't be any worse at scoring goals than the senior team,-1,0
2023-05-02 17:14:11,The difference between us and City is, City win that 5-0. Dunno why we take our foot off the gas so often,0,-1

2023-05-02 17:07:22,I could see Forest strolling into the bridge and turning this Chelsea side over,-1,0
2023-05-02 22:53:39,3-1 win against Chelsea to put us top with 4 games remaining, yet no one cares lol. Crazy how that sounds,1,-1
2023-05-02 17:01:19,Wasn't particularly impressed with how Arsenal played from the 60th Minute onward but 3 points will suffice. Classless supporters with lasers need to be banned from the stadium for life. Hoping it's a minor knock for Gabriel. He's essential for these last EPL fixtures,1,-1
2023-05-02 16:55:41,please just play Mudryk and Madueke for the rest of the season they are literally the only sparks in this team,1,0
2023-05-02 16:56:11,man I can't believe they let us score lmao,1,-1
2023-05-02 17:12:53,Blatantly obvious when you're in a team who create 30-40 chances a game - City, you'll look 10x better than a team who do nothing - Chelsea. Sterling has been a bad bad purchase. I'd put him and Richarlison on the same tier tbh.,1,-1
2023-05-02 16:55:57,We'll all be there for the 007 - Bournemouth don't let us down,1,-1
2023-05-02 16:56:47,Arsenal won the first half, we won the second. I believe they call that a draw, no?,1,-1

2023-05-02 19:28:42,If Chelsea can't win vs Bournemouth or Nottingham Forest, they may actually go down. End the year with City, United and Newcastle,-1,0
2023-05-02 16:56:59,Arsenal really took their foot off the gas in that second half and looked defensively frail whenever Chelsea (one of the worst attacking sides in the league) went forward. Really wouldn't be enthused about their chances at the title after that. Chelsea are just very very bad.,1,-1
2023-05-02 16:57:40,Chelsea are fast becoming the easiest 3 points in the league. Some achievement, considering the relegation battle this year.,1,-1

2023-05-02 16:55:40,It's all right, Chelsea, not every team can be as good as Crystal Palace. Total season wages: Palace -- £67.6 million Chelsea -- £207 million,-1,1
2023-05-02 17:19:49,Chelsea as a team didn't play well, but Noni Madueke was very very good in my opinion. Bright spot for that team for sure,0,-1
2023-05-02 17:29:34,Chelsea desperately need José.,0,-1

2023-05-02 16:58:08,If there was another 8 to 10 games left of this season, Chelsea would become the most expensive Championship club in the history of the game!,-1,-1
2023-05-02 17:00:39,Great 3 points. Hope Gabriel is fine. Still not happy with defence. Any other TOP side would have definitely scored more.,1,-1
2023-05-02 17:00:53,Chelsea were lucky to get away with *just* a 3-1,1,-1
2023-05-02 17:01:43,How do you spend more than half a billion to destroy a club so quickly? This is amazing. They literally managed to build the worst team in the league, in just a few months time. They're only lucky a lot of others had a head start in mismanagement, and then again, they are on par with the likes of Palace and Bournemouth,-1,-1

2023-05-02 17:10:53,Lampard, Lampard, Lampard, I didn't think it could get much lower than the Brighton performance, but those first 45 minutes... ????? Honestly, we're lucky that Arsenal saw how easy it was, so lost motivation and fell into 1st gear. Otherwise we were looking at LEAST at 6-0 pumping. How Bin Laden's protege acquired a coaching licence is a mystery to all. Lampard really needs to humble himself and concede that coaching just isn't for him.,1,-1
2023-05-02 22:26:13,Jose is going to be rubbing his hands excitedly. This is the ideal runway for his return. I hope they get relegated after. I remember him getting them almost relegated the last time he was there. Nice,-1,-1

2023-05-02 17:10:02,We weren't that good today. Chelsea are absolute bottom barrel trash.

2023-05-02 17:06:56,I genuinely don’t understand how Lampard can be this bad considering how good he was as a player. I feel like he fails to see a lot of the things even the fans can see and plays off of emotions and sentiments more than tactics. I don’t know what Chelsea fans think but if I was one I would’ve definitely preferred to keep potter until the season’s over if the alternative is fucking Frank Lampard.,1,-1

2023-05-02 17:00:47,Sterling and Auba must never play for Chelsea again. Beyond dreadful the pair of them. Chelsea looked ok towards the end there with mostly youngsters on, that's got to be the 11 for the rest of the season. I maintain that on paper Arsenal are no better than Chelsea, but tactically they are light years ahead, Arteta could be using non league players and still beat Lampard.,1,-1

2023-05-02 16:58:41,Lampard brought in to steady the ship! He keeps the losing streak going successfully! If he even dares to draw or (lol) win a game by the end of the season, may he catch his dikk in his zipper every morning. The comedy must continue and if he finishes with all losses it will be legit great laughs. After Pochettino comes in I'll be back to hoping for something decent, but right now I just want to watch the clownshow.,1,-1
