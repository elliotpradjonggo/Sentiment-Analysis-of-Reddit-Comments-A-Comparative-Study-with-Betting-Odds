Also I find it baffling that Liverpool didn't feel a more pressing need to improve their midfield given the fact that quite a number of their midfielders are injury prone. The Arthur signing has proven to be a calamitous decision"

No one will sell them their best players out of pity and by the looks of it they need to replace near 4-5 at the minimum. \n\nProb gonna be a huge reset for them as other teams have moved up ahead of them and will prob spend again this summer.

Huge talent but really poor defender, and poor application. He just left Grealish run off him for the last goal, no appetite, zero pride in the performance. Robertson just looks tired. \n\nSalah got the goal, it's crazy but that was all he really did. Looked to be somewhat effective in the first half but offered nothing in the second. \n\nKlopp is at fault for quite a lot of this I think. Man plays 4.3.3 no matter what. Incredible coach, players love him, obviously instils his beliefs in his players, but has zero flexibility as a coach. \n\nCity were phenomenal. The whole team really. Stones looks great in midfield, Grealish and Mahrez ran riot. Alvarez is wasted in City. He will never start over Haaland and is far too good to sit on the bench. Would love to have him at United. Works hard, excellent technically"
