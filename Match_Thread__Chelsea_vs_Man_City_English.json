Via Zoom and whatever. \n\nIt\u2019s now the 10th injury and that\u2019s not acceptable. This season is basically over. Nearly every key player is injured in the long term. \n\n- Kante (got injured again)\n\n- James (got injured again) \n\n- fofana (got injured again in a friendly)\n\n- Broja out the season \n\n- Sterling probably hamstring \n\n- Mount got injured in training \n\n- Pulisic got injured this match \n\n- Mendy shoulder injury \n\n- Chilwell injured\n\n- Ruben Lotus Cheek."

            "comment": "Don't think Pep's 3 at the back worked as well as he wanted it to this game, atleast for the 1st half. They sacrificed one to form that huge overload in the middle with Rodri, Gundogan, Debruyne, and silva playing off eachother (it was like 60-70% possession?). Think he wanted more incision passes into Haaland, but it wasn't working out (think Debruyne plays a little more outwards to play in crosses to him normally, but he felt a lot closer to the middle).  \n\nBut when chelsea pressed that far right side with ziyech and hit city on the counter they def had the upper hand in terms of chances in the 1st half. Didn't help that cancelo / Foden weren't involved enough (less from Foden) and didnt stretch out chelsea enough. \n\n\nPep obviously knows what works and doesnt, akanji in and the kid lewis at rb(who was super good today). Mahrez and Grealish gave that width. Gave city a lot more control in those wide areas imo. Cucurella was sleeping/Mahrez got ahead of Grealish's pass. \n\nIdk how Potter should have responded to City's changes tbh. Chelsea were also unlucky, fucked by injuries, but atleast they saw sparks from: hall, zakaria, and Chukwuemeka."
